# Oxide and Friends Twitter Space: February 7th, 2022

## I Know This! (Purpose-built systems with general-purpose guts)

We've been holding a Twitter Space weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour.
Even though it's not (yet?) a feature of Twitter Spaces, we have been
recording them all; here is

speakers on February 7th included
[MattSci](https://twitter.com/MattSci2),
[Ian](https://twitter.com/iangrunert),
[Matt Ranney](https://twitter.com/mranney) and
