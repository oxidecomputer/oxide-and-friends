Here's (much of) the live chat from the show:

- **ahl** https://github.com/oxidecomputer/oxide-and-friends/blob/master/2021_11_29.md
- **ahl** That's the Sidecar switch episode
- **bcantrill** https://p4.org/
- **admchl** What does "at line rate" mean?
- **Riking** Line rate = As fast as the packets could possibly come. 1Gbit, 10Gbit, 100Gbit, etc
- **admchl** Do you need ASICs to hit that speed? I assume x86_64 is not going to be fast enough for these specialised operations?
- **levon** Yes, the Tofino 2 is the ASIC
- **bcantrill** You need ASICs
- **bnaecker** Yes, you really can't do these kinds of operations on a general purpose CPU.
- **rng_drizzt** Yeah, you need specialized silicon here.
- **JustinAzoff** Right, also often across all ports at the same time in both direction. a 48 port 10gbps switch will have a line rate of 960gbps (10 ** 48 ** 2)
- **duckman** So the advantage is being able to offload compute to the switch?
- **bnaecker** Yes, and specifically that you can separate the data plane (operations on the packets) from the control plane (decisions about what operations to allow or make).
- **tahnok** What's TCAM?
- **levon** Ternary Content Addressable Memory
- **bnaecker** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_memory#Ternary_CAMs
- **ryaeng** Sure beats logging into a number of Cisco switches and making changes at the console.
- **admchl** This is my favourite episode in a long time, this is all really fascinating.
- **rng_drizzt** the first Sidecar episode was nearly 1.5 years ago ü§Ø , right after we cut the first rev
- **levon** That episode blew my mind
- **duckman** This sounds like a big deal on the scale of ebpf
- **duckman** Or bigger
- **bnaecker** It is extremely useful for understanding the processing pipelines. As long as you only run single-packet integration tests üôÇ
- **od0** just want to go out and find things to write P4 code for
- **JustinAzoff** <@354365572554948608> yeah one way to think about that sort of thing is that xdp can be used to run little programs on a nic, where p4 is kind of like that, but running on effectively a nic with 48+ ports
- **bcantrill** https://github.com/oxidecomputer/p4
- **SyntheticGate** sidecar is the "codename" of our switch box
- **SyntheticGate** "gimlet" is our server sled
- **bcantrill** https://github.com/oxidecomputer/propolis
- **wmf** So you have P4 and OPTE in the hypervisor at the same time?
- **bnaecker** OPTE is in the host kernel.
- **arjenroodselaar** The P4 runtime Ry described only exists in the test bed, where it high level simulates the switches. OPTE is part of the production environment.
- **arjenroodselaar** The rough difference between P4 and OPTE is that P4 works on individual packets without much concept of a session (so it can't reason about TCP streams, packet order etc, so no firewall like functionality), while OPTE aims to operate on streams of packets.
- **JustinAzoff** So you can run 100 VMs on a test system and wire them up to your virtual switch compiled by x4c?
- **arjenroodselaar** Correct.
- **bcantrill** OPTE == Oxide Packet Transformation Engine
- **admchl** Gimlet?
- **rng_drizzt** Compute server
- **rng_drizzt** The Sidecar switch is actually _just_ a PCIe peripheral to a Gimlet.
- **bnaecker** The Gimlet managing the Sidecar is often called a "Scrimlet" for "Sidecar attached Gimlet"
- **Riking** and "how do i reconfigure this giant network without hosing my ability to reconfigure this giant network"
- **ShaunO** can identify with that - we seriously struggle to keep our own products inter-operating, let alone anyone else's
- **levon** It can feel like a Sisyphean task.
- **a172** Setup a much smaller/simpler network in parallel that is accessible from "not your network" that gets you to the management interface.
- **levon** It's a whole new world when you can look at the actual table definitions in  P4
- **rng_drizzt** Owning all the layers here is immensely beneficial
- **levon** Those DTrace probes have been very helpful
- **bnaecker** Those probes turned out to be everywhere. They are are in: SQL queries, HTTP queries, log messages, Propolis hypervisor state, virtual storage system, networking protocol messages, the P4 emulator, and probably more that I'm forgetting about.
- **levon** For those unfamiliar with the DTrace tool, or the rationale behind leveraging DTrace over other tracing / debugging tools:
https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall05/cos518/papers/dtrace.pdf
- **bcantrill** https://github.com/oxidecomputer/progenitor
- **ahl** some notes on rust codegen: https://github.com/ahl/codegen-template
- **ahl** "When I'm generating code in other languages, I feel like I am 100% doing it wrong and it's going to be just this undebuggable pile, and in Rust, it's like I'm, you know, only 20% sure I'm doing it wrong and it's a semi-debuggable pile but the amount of time it saves and the sort of elegance and testability of it is just phenomenal." 
- **arjenroodselaar** DDM! Bring us home!
- **a172** it astonishes me how many "cloud" type architectures are built on v4 only or v4 first.
- **a172** IPv6 is _older than Wi-Fi_
- **a172** It solves _real problems_. **PLEASE** use it.
- **nyanotech** yessss finally someone realizes broadcast domains are also failure domains
- **JustinAzoff** the worst part of v6 is trying to run dual stack v4+v6, v6 only networks are fairly simple
- **levon** And the bigger the broadcast domain, the more irritating it is to troubleshoot it
- **bcantrill** "Hash and pray"
- **arjenroodselaar** FWIW while DDM is a cool thing we're building, one of the "simple" tasks Tofino does for us is NAT between the networks of our customers and their VPC networks they implement on our platform.
- **arjenroodselaar** Simple NAT is still surprisingly expensive and being able to do that at line rate is pretty nice.
- **Riking** TCP retransmits in steady state seems like an obvious observation point?
- **arjenroodselaar** Yes, you see TCP retransmits.
- **arjenroodselaar** But if you're running say Memcache over UDP and you get a sudden burst of incoming data as a result of a large number of cache queries you drop those packets (because the buffers can't keep up) and you see cache request timeouts.
- **arjenroodselaar** FB did some work on this about 10 years ago to avoid this ingest and dropped packets which hurt your p99 latency.
- **Riking** yeah smartnic is pushing the intelligence to the machine
- **levon** I know someone who basically polled all of the switches for buffer drops in an attempt to divine which paths were dropping packets due to micro-congestion
- **admchl** I feel like I'm in a secret society meeting learning The Hidden Truth behind Reality of The Network
- **wmf** I would argue if the entire hypervisor is on the smart NIC then you're no worse off than the Oxide architecture
- **a172** I once stumbled on a bug where the vendor's custom protocol for monitoring (because snmp/syslog just can't keep up) had a trace log on the process, that could not be turned off. Some sort of race condition enabled it, and it happened on 1/3 of system boots. It was ~20k logs/s, iirc.
- **a172** (im going to look up those numbers)
- **levon** I haven't worked with a SmartNIC fast enough to do this well
- **JustinAzoff** We use a FPGA Nic in our products for fast packet capturing. the service that bootstraps it had an issue that caused it to log an error... for every single packet...
- **JustinAzoff** that managed to log the same error something like 250,000 times a second
- **arjenroodselaar** The problem with SmartNICs is that their power features are way less advanced than the power scaling that x86 CPUs do. So you either run them or you don't, and they come with a 50-75W penalty. Unless you can really get useful work done for that 50W budget, a x86 CPU is much more flexible.
- **arjenroodselaar** What we really want is an AMD Epyc SoC with some amount of FPGA fabric That would let you build whatever makes sense there while still having much of the flexibility with respect to how/where you consume power.
- **a172** It was enough to mess us up. 250k would have killed us even faster.
- **JustinAzoff** Yeah, it happily wrote that error message until the multi TB data array filled up. We reworked how log rate limiting and log rotation worked after that
- **a172** I was mostly amused that the process that the process that existed because snmp/syslog couldn't keep up was getting a syslog for every iteration of a loop in the process
- **a172** of course, if you are sending a packet for every packet you send, that sounds like it quickly becomes an exponential problem.
- **JustinAzoff** and to circle back around, this was code inside of the vendor SDK, that is not open source, that we couldn't fix ourselves. it's one of the only components of our system that we don't control. i wish we had our own NIC (that would probably run something like p4)
- **levon** And thus, this is how we become the way we are (at Oxide)
- **a172** ours was on production network hardware (wireless controller). There is no hope of having source or any ~~insight~~ true observability into it. (edit: saying there was _no_ insight is a little harsh)
- **JustinAzoff** one thing that came up before was if p4 was like ebpf.. there's actually a ebpf backend for p4 that supports some of the features: https://github.com/p4lang/p4c/blob/main/backends/ebpf/README.md
- **bcantrill** Thanks, all!
