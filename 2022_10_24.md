# Oxide and Friends Twitter Space: October 24th, 2022

## Open Source Inside Baseball

We've been holding a Twitter Space weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour.
Even though it's not (yet?) a feature of Twitter Spaces, we have been
recording them all; here is
[the recording for our Twitter Space for October 24th, 2022](https://youtu.be/UygfNt5oLmM).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://twitter.com/ahl),
our special guest was dear friend-of-Oxide,
[Stephen O'Grady](https://twitter.com/sogrady).
Other speakers on October 24th included
[Ian Rountree](https://twitter.com/IanRountree).
(Did we miss your name and/or get it wrong? Drop a PR!)

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- [Monktoberfest](https://monktoberfest.com/) - Red Monk's annual conference in Maine
- [@7:40](https://youtu.be/UygfNt5oLmM?t=460)
  *cheating in baseball*
- [The shot heard 'round the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_Heard_%27Round_the_World_(baseball))
- For non-American and/or non-baseball fans "inside baseball" is an idiom meaning "an expert's take or opinion"
- Also, Stephen, Bryan, and Adam love actual baseball so there was quite a bit of that as well...
- For the baseball fans, [the Bryce Harper at bat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efDLfPEn07s) we were so excited about
- [@12:55](https://youtu.be/UygfNt5oLmM?t=775)
  *The main event*
- Stephen's [The Dead End](https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2022/09/23/dead-end/)
- [@20:45](https://youtu.be/UygfNt5oLmM?t=775)
  *The smoke-filled room with CTOs collaborating*
- No concern for collateral damage to the industry, the future of software, see also hustle porn
- [Commons Clause](https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2018/09/10/tragedy-of-the-commons-clause/)
- [@20:55](https://youtu.be/UygfNt5oLmM?t=1255)
  *EULA-like language*
- What does a EULA mean if I can build the software myself
- Lack of case law around open-source licensing, even lack of legal precision in the language
- lawyers messaging to other lawyers
- trying to use a license to solve a business model problem
- [@29:40](https://youtu.be/UygfNt5oLmM?t=1780)
  *Bryan's VC rant*
- VCs build to flip, short time horizons
- using open-source downloads as a proxy for product-market-fit
- You could not have built Google, Amazon, Meta - without open-source software
- Pulling up the ladders
- [@41:45](https://youtu.be/UygfNt5oLmM?t=2505)
  *Immanual Kant*
- [The Categorical Imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative)
- One person littering isn't a big deal.  Everyone littering is a big deal.
- [@51:40](https://youtu.be/UygfNt5oLmM?t=3100)
  *Lower-hanging fruit in the industry, ripe for ruining*
- infrastructure middleware, market where people have historically been willing to throw money at it
- Impossible to relicense projects with sufficiently large contributors and no assignment of copyright - Linux would be beyond impossible
- [left-pad incident](https://www.theregister.com/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos/)
- Uniqueness of Red Hat's evolution
- Open is the default for today's developers, but that openness was hard fought and hard won
