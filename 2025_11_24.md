# Oxide and Friends: November 24th, 2025

## A grown-up ZFS data corruption bug

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording](https://youtu.be/96QCoaHAhgM).

Hey hey! We recently tripped over a ZFS data corruption bug–introduced over 18
years ago! Bryan and Adam discuss with members of the Oxide team as well as
Matt Ahrens, the co-inventor of ZFS.

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://bsky.app/profile/bcantrill.bsky.social) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://bsky.app/profile/ahl.bsky.social),
speakers included
Alan Hanson,
[Matt Keeter](https://hachyderm.io/@mjk),
Andy Fiddaman,
[John Gallagher](https://hachyderm.io/@nerdyjkg),
and special guest, Matt Ahrens.
