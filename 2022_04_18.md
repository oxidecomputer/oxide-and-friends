# Oxide and Friends Twitter Space: April 18th, 2022

## More Tales from the Bringup Lab

We've been holding a Twitter Space weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour.
Even though it's not (yet?) a feature of Twitter Spaces, we have been
recording them all; here is

always love to hear from new speakers!
