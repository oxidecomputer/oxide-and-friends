# Oxide and Friends Twitter Space: June 27th, 2022

## Book in the box redux

We've been holding a Twitter Space weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour.
Even though it's not (yet?) a feature of Twitter Spaces, we have been
recording them all; here is
[the recording for our Twitter Space for June 27th, 2022](https://youtu.be/V85oeH4Byy0).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://twitter.com/ahl),
our special guest was
[Scott Johnson](https://twitter.com/fuzzygroup). Other speakers included
[XX]()
and [YY]().
