# Oxide and Friends Twitter Space: October 10th, 2022

## Holistic Boot

We've been holding a Twitter Space weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour.
Even though it's not (yet?) a feature of Twitter Spaces, we have been
recording them all; here is
[the recording for our Twitter Space for October 10th, 2022](https://youtu.be/KItJzncvjFk).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://twitter.com/ahl),
speakers on October 10th included
[Tom Lyon](@aka_pugs@mastodon.social),
Dave,
[Steve Klabnik](https://twitter.com/steveklabnik),
[Joshua Clulow](https://twitter.com/jmclulow),
[Matt Campbell](@matt@toot.cafe),
[Ian Rountree](https://twitter.com/IanRountree),
and Todd.
(Did we miss your name and/or get it wrong? Drop a PR!)

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- [Topic](link)
- [@M:SS](link into recording)
- [@0:25](https://youtu.be/KItJzncvjFk?t=25)
  *Bryan's OSFC talk*
- [Talk made it to the top of Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33145411)
- [Firmware-first error handling](https://uefi.org/htmlspecs/ACPI_Spec_6_4_html/18_ACPI_Platform_Error_Interfaces/firmware-first-error-handling.html)
- At Joyent, machines were dying with uncorrectable memory errors, and reporting 0 correctable errors, because the firmware-first model was hiding them
- [@7:54](https://youtu.be/KItJzncvjFk?t=474)
  *Redfish boot order works like 60% of the time*
- [Redfish thing to let you control boot order](https://www.supermicro.com/manuals/other/RedfishRefGuide.pdf)
- People have internalized this is the way things have always been and must always be
- Standards are incredibly wide, poorly specified
- Tom's take: people don't stick to standards, and the problem with Redfish is that it's just a syntax
- Everything being a subset or a superset of a standard is no standard at all
- [Conway's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law)
- You can see from the API spec what the org chart is
- [@17:30](https://youtu.be/KItJzncvjFk?t=1050)
  *Getting away from the BMC*
- You want this to be well controlled, and a web interface probably isn't the right thing
- Needing DRAM to start the BMC, which means DIMM training...
- Elimination of proprietary BIOS that executes before the bootloader, unseen
- Industry problem: There's an unfortunate co-dependency between microprocessor vendors and BIOS writers
- This leads to a fragility, because you get it working, and don't touch it, and don't write anything down.
- Low levels of firmware knowing things are very wrong, and soldiering on to make do with what it can find: 3 GHz CPU pinned at 800 MHz, half the memory bus failed, so just use the other half...
- Consumer electronics heritage - Going to great lengths to ensure you don't get a support call
- Vendors responding "this is only a you problem, we're not hearing this from anyone else"
- [@32:00](https://youtu.be/KItJzncvjFk?t=1920)
- The curse of vertical integration
- The fastest way to deflect blame is to find something different about what you were doing
- Richmond 16 (how many bug numbers do you know)
- software is running that has ruined the OS's memory
- [@37:15](https://youtu.be/KItJzncvjFk?t=2235)
  *SMM - System Management Mode*
- At any time, for any duration, for many reasons, the CPU can enter and do whatever it wants, and there's no way for the OS to know it happened
- Originally for laptop suspend and resume without OS support
- The amount of software in there is confounding (a mouse driver?!)
- [@52:17](https://youtu.be/KItJzncvjFk?t=3137)
  *Question from Todd - How much does your design constrain you from using different hardware?*
- Big lift to go to Intel x86 from AMD
- Re: holistic boot, the host CPU is the most affected piece of hardware, because the integration is tight
- Would still be a lot of work to go to a different host even if they didn't have a holistic boot, but they'd have very little insight into the underworkings
- Todd's experience - a 17,000 GPU system in a DC for hosting thousands of nodes.  Boot time is hours, bought 5 years out.
- [@59:10](https://youtu.be/KItJzncvjFk?t=3550)
  *Open source software is a big deal*
- Open source software is important.  It's staggering to think of doing this without open source
- Rust is culmination of many different layers of open source
- Platform enablement needs to be open source, can't do with with the way Nvidia operates now
- [@1:04:05](https://youtu.be/KItJzncvjFk?t=3845)
  *This station is now under computer control*
- Obscure Star Trek III reference
- [@1:12:49](https://youtu.be/KItJzncvjFk?t=4369)
  *The hubris kernel as a development environment*
- can sleep, debuggable
- typical kernel is very constrained
- we enter in full 64-bit mode with virtual memory enabled
- [pico host boot loader](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/phbl)
- [include_bytes](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.include_bytes.html) makes testing easy
- [elfwrap](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E36784_01/html/E36870/elfwrap-1.html)
- [@1:27:50](https://youtu.be/KItJzncvjFk?t=5270)
  *Question - Have you considered running a server with L3 and not RAM*
- Memory comes to the OS trained, it just takes a minute
- May be some workloads where it makes sense - Finance, but likely need more than a GB

Our next Twitter space will likely be on Monday at 5p Pacific Time; stay tuned
to our Twitter feeds for details.  We'd love to have you join us, as we
always love to hear from new speakers!
