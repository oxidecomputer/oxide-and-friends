# Oxide and Friends Twitter Space: May 16th, 2022

## Debugging Methodologies

We've been holding a Twitter Space weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour.
Even though it's not (yet?) a feature of Twitter Spaces, we have been
recording them all; here is
[the recording for our Twitter Space for May 16th, 2022](https://youtu.be/7B2y0-t0SKI).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://twitter.com/ahl),
our special guests on May 16th were
[Jordan Hendricks](https://twitter.com/itsajordansystm) and
[Luqman Aden](https://twitter.com/luqma_).
Other speakers included
[XXX](),
and [YY]().

always love to hear from new speakers!
