  All good GPT AI systems are expensive enough that their frivolous use declines significantly.
  It's still used significantly in Academic Misconduct, because it's cheaper than the alternatives.
</td>
<td>
  A new trend, called something stupid like Web3, or Web4, emerges. Probably to do with AI
  or the "Metaverse". Some people make a lot of money, but time proves it is also a fad.
</td>
<td>
  A large/prestigious university starts teaching CS1 in Rust. Time reveals it is a mistake.
