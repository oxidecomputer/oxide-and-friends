  All good GPT AI systems are expensive enough that their frivolous use declines significantly.
  It's still used significantly in Academic Misconduct, because it's cheaper than the alternatives.
</td>
<td>
  A new trend, called something stupid like Web3, or Web4, emerges. Probably to do with AI
  or the "Metaverse". Some people make a lot of money, but time proves it is also a fad.
</td>
<td>
  A large/prestigious university starts teaching CS1 in Rust. Time reveals it is a mistake.

Tree(d) Borrows is implemented in Miri. Users are excited that it theoretically permits <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/256">the &Header pattern</a>, but in aggregate sentiment changes little from Stacked Borrows because it doesn't have much of an impact on how many crates contain aliasing UB.

<td>
Rustc has an SSA IR to support more advanced pre-LLVM optimizations in the name of compile time improvements. The Rust same code generates less work for LLVM, but overall the improvement is mostly not felt because most codebases grow in complexity over the same period.
</td>
<td>
As a result of the work by the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3346">Operational Semantics Team</a>, rustc does powerful Rust-specific aliasing optimizations. Rust is widely regarded as a faster language than C and C++.
