# Oxide and Friends: January 12th, 2026

## Engineering Rigor in the LLM Age

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording](https://youtu.be/fmFt4-jjEc0).

What do LLMs mean for the future of software engineering? Will vibe-coded AI slop be the norm? Will software engineers simply be less in-demand? Rain and David join Bryan and Adam to discuss how rigorous use of LLMs can make for much more robust systems. 

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://bsky.app/profile/bcantrill.bsky.social) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://bsky.app/profile/ahl.bsky.social),
we were joined by
[Rain Paharia](https://bsky.app/profile/sunshowers.io),
and [David Crespo](https://bsky.app/profile/davidcrespo.bsky.social).
