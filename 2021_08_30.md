# Oxide and Friends Twitter Space: August 30th, 2021

## A brief history of talking computers

We've been holding a Twitter Space weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour.
Even though it's not (yet?) a feature of Twitter Spaces, we have been
recording them all; here is
[the recording for our Twitter Space for August 30, 2021](https://youtu.be/b9GVJg0LRX4).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://twitter.com/ahl),
speakers on August 30th included special guest
[Matt Campbell](https://twitter.com/mw_campbell),
as well as
[XXX](),
and [YY]().

Our next Twitter space will likely be on Monday at 5p Pacific Time; stay tuned

always love to hear from new speakers!
