# Oxide and Friends Twitter Space: April 4th, 2022

## Another LPC55 ROM Vulnerability

We've been holding a Twitter Space weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour.
Even though it's not (yet?) a feature of Twitter Spaces, we have been
recording them all; here is
[the recording for our Twitter Space for April 4th, 2022](https://youtu.be/mi_NKpwIrfI).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://twitter.com/ahl),
our special guest was
[Laura Abbott](https://twitter.com/openlabbott).

Other speakers on April 4th included
[Ian](https://twitter.com/iangrunert),
[jasonbking](https://twitter.com/jasonbking),
[Todd Gamblin?](https://twitter.com/tgamblin),
[Ben ?](),
[MattSci](https://twitter.com/MattSci2),
[jasonbking](https://twitter.com/jasonbking) and 
[Evan?]().

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- Jonathan Goldstein's [Heavyweight](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/heavyweight) podcast
- Oxide and Friends podcast
  - [transistor.fm](https://oxide-and-friends.transistor.fm/) launch point,
    has links to Spotify, Google, Amazon etc players
- Laura did talk about the first LPC55 vulnerability in the May 3, 2021 space,
  but the recording for that day missed it.
  - Laura Abbott (30 April, 2021) _Exploiting Undocumented Hardware Blocks in the LPC55S69_
    [write-up](https://oxide.computer/blog/lpc55)
    - And DEF CON [talk](https://youtu.be/eKKgaGbcq4o) with Rick Altherr
- [@4:01](https://youtu.be/Q0rguwyay_0?t=241)
  Today's topic: Laura Abbott (23 March 2022) _Another vulnerability in the LPC55S69 ROM_
  [write up](https://oxide.computer/blog/another-vulnerability-in-the-lpc55s69-rom)
  - How do you brick a chip?
- [@7:20](https://youtu.be/Q0rguwyay_0?t=440)
  The spreadsheet, ROM patch after boot
  - Company dismisses or downplays vulnerabilities
  - Sees CVEs as optional??
- [@15:19](https://youtu.be/Q0rguwyay_0?t=919)
  CVEs as more software focused. What does a CVE for hardware even mean?
  - NXP doesn't want to open their software
  > "Even though we are not believers in security by obscurity, the product specific
  > ROM code is not open to external parties except for approved test labs for
  > vulnerability reviews"
- [@19:43](https://youtu.be/Q0rguwyay_0?t=1183)
  The story of the current vulnerability
  - [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/)
- [@27:26](https://youtu.be/Q0rguwyay_0?t=1646)
  Picking apart the code
  - Bounds checks, writing outside the bounds of the buffer
  - [DICE](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/work-groups/dice-architectures/)
    by Trusted Computing Group
  - Request for Discussion
  - Evaluating potential chips when building a product
- [@41:09](https://youtu.be/Q0rguwyay_0?t=2469)
  Secure hardware, work around potential pitfalls
  - Open source would help
- [@45:37](https://youtu.be/Q0rguwyay_0?t=2737)
  Disclosed to NXP, more receptive this time
  - Discussion on [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30778778)
  - [@54:21](https://youtu.be/Q0rguwyay_0?t=3261)
    Security review industry
- [@57:11](https://youtu.be/Q0rguwyay_0?t=3431)
  Ian: building up your own (open) documentation on LPC55?
- [@1:01:31](https://youtu.be/Q0rguwyay_0?t=3691)
  Jason: questionable definitions of "open" source
  - Access to source as building confidence in the product
- [@1:05:20](https://youtu.be/Q0rguwyay_0?t=3920)
  Todd: securing supply chain for code in
  large scale projects with lots of contributors
  - Vulnerabilities can occur so easily
- [@1:08:54](https://youtu.be/Q0rguwyay_0?t=4134)
  Ben: custom setups abound. Hard to trust a whole stack of assembled pieces
- [@1:12:16](https://youtu.be/Q0rguwyay_0?t=4336)
  Matt: what is the ROM doing? Assembly or C?
  Could the provider's hands be tied as far as releasing proprietary code?
- [@1:17:19](https://youtu.be/Q0rguwyay_0?t=4639)
  Jason: [X.509](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509) parsing
  as a good place to look for vulnerabilities?
- [@1:18:25](https://youtu.be/Q0rguwyay_0?t=4705)
  Evan: encouragement around fuzzing X.509
- Next time: more tales from the bringup lab!

If we got something wrong or missed something, please file a PR!
Our next Twitter space will likely be on Monday at 5p Pacific Time; stay tuned
to our Twitter feeds for details.  We'd love to have you join us, as we
always love to hear from new speakers!
