Apple VR will do well, but not take over the world. "Do well" means "well enough that they'll do a second revision." Not a Newton, but not an iPhone.
</td>
<td>
The counter to <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1743747172795810051">this post by Elon Musk</a>: "Done right, a compiler should be able to figure out type automatically. It’s not that hard. Not that it will matter much in the AI future." More people will use AI, but it's not going to have any impact on programming language development yet.
</td>
<td>
Two parts: C++ will be considered a legacy programming language, and that C will see a small resurgance but not return to its earlier glory days.

</td>
<td>
There will be a major privacy scandal only enabled by AI processing of video
chat recordings.
</td>
<td>
Rise of logging mechanisms that are optimized for machine-/LLM-based consumption
rather than human-based consumption
<hr>
LLM-based processing allows for the "cleanliness bar" around data to be lowered,
giving rise to real data provenance 
</td>
<td>
Dashboarding-for-everything gives way to AI-based causal reasoning to make
sense of conflicting evidence from complex systems -- an AI-based
"President’s Daily Brief" for systems
</td>

<td>
The idea of AI-based doom (e.g., "p(doom)", "x-risk") is out of the lexicon --
and Doomers take credit for saving us
</td>
<td>
LLMs have completely revolutionized search; pre-LLM search feels antiquated
</td>
<td>
Recorded meetings + LLM-based inference gives rise to a new 
approach ("omnocracy"?) that serves to automate middle management.
<hr>
LLMs have revolutionized K-8 education
<hr>
Robotics are still not meaningfully in the home
<hr>
Some wealthy enclaves have banned drone delivery
