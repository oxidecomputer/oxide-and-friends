The counter to <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1743747172795810051">this post by Elon Musk</a>: "Done right, a compiler should be able to figure out type automatically. It’s not that hard. Not that it will matter much in the AI future." More people will use AI, but it's not going to have any impact on programming language development yet.
