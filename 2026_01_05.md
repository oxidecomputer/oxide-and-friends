# Oxide and Friends: January 5th, 2026

## Predictions 2026!!

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording](https://youtu.be/lVDhQMiAbR8).

Time for the annual predictions episode! Bryan and Adam were joined by frequent future-ologists Simon Willison, Steve Klabnik, and Ian Grunert to review past predictions and peer into the future. If any of these predictions come to fruition, it's going to be an interest 1, 3, or 6 years!

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://bsky.app/profile/bcantrill.bsky.social) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://bsky.app/profile/ahl.bsky.social),
speakers included
[Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net),
[Steve Klabnik](https://bsky.app/profile/steveklabnik.com),
and [Ian Grunert](https://hachyderm.io/@iangrunert).

    Our own challenger disaster with respect to coding agent security - see <a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2025/the-normalization-of-deviance-in-ai/">the Normalization of Deviance in AI</a> by Johann Rehberger

    Kākāpō parrots in New Zealand are going to have a <em>really good</em> breeding season

    Something that seems impossible for a coding agent to build today - like a full working web browser - won't just be built by coding agents, it will be unsurprising
    <hr>
    We will find out if the Jevons paradox saves our careers as software engineers or not
</td>

    The number of people employed to type code into computers will drop to almost nothing - it will be like punch card operators. Those of us who write code today will have very different jobs that still build software and take advantage of our previous coding experience.

    "Vibe coding" is out of the lexicon -- or used strictly pejoratively
    <hr>
    AI-induced ennui among software engineers becomes so widespread that
    it becomes a named condition (for which Adam -- in an act of nomenclature
    genius rivaling The Leventhal Conundrum -- suggested "Deep Blue")
    <hr>
    A frontier model company has a prominent whitepaper making the case that
    AI will lead to broad-based prosperity rather than job loss
    <hr>
    Harvey.ai becomes the pets.com of the AI boom -- and a harbinger of the

    <hr>
    A prominent S1 has revalations of economic behavior that has an 
    effect beyond the company's IPO

    Custom-written software thrives in lieu of SaaS

  Agent Orchestration will still be a hot topic. It'll be partially, but not entirely, solved.

  Updated with some more rigour: We won't have a "kubernetes for agents" just yet.
</td>
<td>
  Using AI tools when writing software professionally will be considered something closer to using autocomplete or syntax highlighting than something controversial or exceptional.

  AI will not have caused the total collapse of our economic and governmental systems.

In a random sampling of the top 10 buzziest tech companies, 75% of designer job postings will list code as a requirement (not nice-to-have). At least 20% will specifically mention shipping to production.
</td>
<td>
It will be clear that peak tech worker was 2022, but total tech employment won't have declined 50% from that peak.<br><br>"VCO" (Vibe Coding Obsession) will be a recognized condition—people struggling to focus because AI tools make everything too easy to build, leading to scattered attention and compulsive project-starting.

</td>
<td>
LLMs being able to write code based on specifications and make test suites pass will cause more projects to document how they are supposed to work.  We've already seen people writing more in order to make llms work better, but the same writing also benefits humans.  CLAUDE.MD -> good documentation for how to work on a project
</td>
<td>
An autonomous robot {humanoid, dog, espresso machine} will murder someone and the legal system will struggle with how to assign blame.
</td>
<td>
Less a prediction, but I hope models become fully open and reproducable.  There is a lot of software being built on top of closed models.  If you can't retrain the model (at any cost) you won't own anything.
