# Oxide and Friends: June 9th, 2025

## Debugger-driven Development

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording](https://youtu.be/hdqcrj5TBvE).

Building systems software can be quite opaque, leading to the need for great debugging tools. At Oxide, we've found that debuggers can be even more valuable *leading* rather than *following* system development. Bryan and Adam talk with Oxide colleagues about how domain specific debugging tools help us build systems not only more robustly, but faster as well.

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://bsky.app/profile/bcantrill.bsky.social) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://bsky.app/profile/ahl.bsky.social),
we were joined by Oxide colleagues,
[Dave Pacheco](https://hachyderm.io/@dap).
[John Gallagher](https://hachyderm.io/@nerdyjkg),
Alan Hanson,
and [Eliza Weisman](https://bsky.app/profile/elizas.website).
