# Oxide and Friends Twitter Space: July 5, 2021

## NeXT, Objective-C, and contrasting histories

We've been holding a Twitter Space weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour.
Even though it's not (yet?) a feature of Twitter Spaces, we have been
recording them all; here is
[the recording for our Twitter Space for July 5, 2021](https://youtu.be/2H9XQBdLB0Y).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://twitter.com/ahl),
speakers on July 5th included
[Tom Lyon](https://twitter.com/aka_pugs),
[Ian](),
[bch](https://twitter.com/bcharder),
[Theo Schlossnagle](https://twitter.com/postwait),
[Rick Altherr](https://twitter.com/kc8apf),
and [Nate](https://twitter.com/perlhack).

- [NeXTcube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTcube)

  NeXT was a really proprietary company, contrasted with Sun, a really open company.
  > Bill Gates volunteers that he would gladly urinate on a NeXT machine.

  > They are attempting to reinvent absolutely everything, so they
  > need all software to be written from scratch, effectively.

  > Then Steve Jobs calls him an a**hole and storms out.
- [@23:35](https://youtu.be/2H9XQBdLB0Y?t=1415)
  NeXT spent very freely. Lavish offices, catering, etc

  > he was a genius or not, he wasn't selling any computers.
  
  > The 80's were all about fear of Japan.

  > Ultimately they had to pivot away from hardware.

  - NDAs signed per project
