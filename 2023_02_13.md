# Oxide and Friends: February 13th, 2023

## Memory Safety with Yael Grauer

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording from February 13th, 2023](https://youtu.be/NRtj8XzKLUQ).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://mastodon.social/@bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://mastodon.social/@ahl),
we were joined by special guest
[Yael Grauer](https://mastodon.social/@yaelwrites),
and [Steve Klabnik](https://twitter.com/steveklabnik).

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them (experiment in turning the show live-chat into notes):

- **Nahum:** https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-3-2-1-backup-strategy/ if anyone wants to read up on the 3-2-1 Backup strategy. üëÖ
- **Cyborus:** can we get a link to the talk?
- **Nahum:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9s2NxILBK8
- **Nahum:** https://digital-lab-wp.consumerreports.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Memory-Safety-Convening-Report-.pdf via https://digital-lab-wp.consumerreports.org/2023/01/23/new-report-future-of-memory-safety/
- **Nahum:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasus_(spyware)
- **Cyborus:** "can we talk" => "hey. you. have a panic attack. anyways i got a cool sandwich"
- **AaronW:** "of course we should have seatbelts" üòÑ
- **MattCampbell:** but then you've got the C die-hards who say that Rust itself is too complex
- **AaronW:** https://twitter.com/markrussinovich/status/1571995117233504257?s=46
- **DanCrossNYC:** People used to say the same thing about PL/I and recently the COBOL people have been saying the same thing. Nothing new under the sun.
- **statuscalamitous:** https://blog.yossarian.net/2023/02/11/The-unsafe-language-doom-principle
- **DanCrossNYC:** People who still want to treat C as a high-level assembler are saying the same stuff the PL/I people were saying when I was young.
- **Eric Likness - carpetbomberz.com:** In support of Yael, Ralph Nader wasn't/isn't an automotive engineer and he could still argue for lowering safety risks to car buyers. It's advocacy.
- **cdaringe:** As an ocaml user, i was hoping revery would take off https://github.com/revery-ui/revery
- **statuscalamitous:** https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691174952/the-tyranny-of-metrics
- **Saethlin:** Wake up babe, new 0xide reading assignment dropped
- **AaronW:** Labelled like a can of pringles --  "20% more malloc() free()!"
- **Nahum:** Relevant to rules based accounting: https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/02/hacking-the-tax-code.html
- **drew:** Rigorous definitions of ‚Äúunsafe code‚Äù just won't cut it ig
- **ig:** 40% less direct pointer arithmetic than the leading brand of operating systems
- **a172:** How does principle based accounting even work? Like, how do you define if something violates the principle or not, without just turning it back into rules based?
- **Eden:** Checkboxes are meaningful for operational checklists. Aviation and medicine use them pretty heavily. Not so meaningful for systemic work like developing a new aircraft or a new surgery.
- **Eden:** So I guess a rules-based approach works for lines of code, but breaks down for project-level decisions such as which language to use.
- **Saethlin:** The S in IoT is for security
- **benstoltz:** ifixit repairability score for HW should have an analog for SW/FW.
- **DanCrossNYC:** That's precisely what the pl/i folks acted like 25 years ago.
- **sam801:** c++ will live on thru carbon, cppfront, and val.
- **DanCrossNYC:** Prediction: carbon is doa.
- **Saethlin:** I'll believe it once anyone uses those
- **ig:** I think the other part is there's some really important pieces of software that everyone uses daily which use memory unsafe languages. Our web browsers, and our operating systems.
- **AaronW:** I live in a condo and I still unplug expensive electronics during a thunderstorm. Maybe it's because I had many electronics fried when I was young, and my first language was C++.
- **Eric Likness - carpetbomberz.com:** Same with answering a landline during a thunderstorm.
- **DanCrossNYC:** Had to stop training during thunderstorms in the Marines.
- **Eden:** My day job is security. üòâ I rail against compliance checklists on a regular basis because a lot of auditors insist on the checkbox rather than proper security consideration. For example, PCI-DSS requires password rotation, which everyone has known for decades leads to users picking worse passwords.
- **alilleybrinker:** https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec22summer_alexopoulos.pdf
- **statuscalamitous:** https://security.googleblog.com/2022/12/memory-safe-languages-in-android-13.html
- **a172:** Google and Mozilla are making pretty good strides in migrating their browser to Rust. Still a _ton_ of work to go, but entire systems have been moved to Rust.
- **JamesBrock:** "Lindy" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect
- **statuscalamitous:** https://security.googleblog.com/2021/04/rust-in-android-platform.html
- **DanCrossNYC:** Another issue with C/C++ in particular is that UB causes latent bugs to surface years later.
- **alilleybrinker:** In the paper linked above, the average lifetime looks to have been about 3.5 years.
- **Saethlin:** I learned Rust faster than C++
- **alilleybrinker:** Related, you might be interested in EPSS: https://www.first.org/epss/
- **DanCrossNYC:** Rust requires a bit of humility. For veteran C programmers, that can be a gut punch.
- **srockets:** ‚ÄúCompiler says no‚Äù is something that Haskell was proud of, but Rust is the first language I‚Äôve seen that managed to get popular despite of it
- **alilleybrinker:** Humility also requires a lot of Rust https://github.com/oxidecomputer/humility
- **Eden:** I do like the checklist item that every change must be accompanied by a ticket number. Then the company goes and changes the ticket system, and we lose all our history of why things are in place until it slowly builds up again.
- **Eden:** Seriously, checklists are great for operational tasks. Always include a ticket number. Always back up the config in this way ahead of time. Always notify these teams in this way when you're starting a change.
- **AaronW:** I have often wondered about learning multiple languages in parallel.
- **JamesBrock:** The easiest language to teach and learn will be Roc lang, too bad it's not ready yet.
- **AaronW:** A Python and Rust/Go, etc.
- **srockets:** As a first programming course?
- **alilleybrinker:** I've taught Rust to undergrads in a university Programming Languages course, which was it's own unique thing because it's about learning underlying concepts, not Rust per se.
- **drew:** We are getting dangerously close to the ‚Äúteaches class in rust and then realizes it was a bad idea‚Äù prediction..!.
- **ig:** Under the "Government and Advocacy" part of the recommendations - there's probably an angle where FedRAMP Authorization could be used to drive increased usage of memory safe languages.
- **srockets:** As a first programming course I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to work. As 2nd course, that would  be great dedactically I think
- **ahl:** why not the SEC?
- **statuscalamitous:** everything is securities fraud
- **alilleybrinker:** Unsafe code? Securities fraud
- **alilleybrinker:** https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4808083/user-clip-rust-language-chosen
- **alilleybrinker:** Clip of that hearing.
- **DanCrossNYC:** At what point do we start putting in place Professional Engineer qualifications for software engineers, overseen by IEEE or something
- **Eden:** There are very few aircraft manufacturers and very few aircraft operators compared to software manufacturers and distributors/operators.
- **Cyborus:** "our product isn't hackable" is just seen as a challenge
- **AaronW:** Unbreakable Linux!
- **Eden:** So when there's an incident with an aircraft, the NTSB has very few people to talk to in the investigation.
- **mxshift:** "isn't hackable" usually is in the same list as "military-grade encryption"
- **statuscalamitous:** http://www.paulgraham.com/hijack.html
- **Cyborus:** oh that's awful
- **alilleybrinker:** Wow and it's still up
- **Sevan:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqgS4UT8Lp4
- **ig:** https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/ Section 4 is all about the software supply chain, and in this case it was the Secretary of Commerce and NIST was involved. Don't think it mentions memory safety, though.
- **ahl:** Klabnik 2024!
- **ig:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Ring
- **alilleybrinker:** Hey, also fun to note that the OpenSSF has an in-progress workstream (starting this week) to advocate for / advance the use of memory safe languages in open source.
- **Saethlin:** The Silicon Ring
- **Nahum:** For me the Therac 25 paper in college was really chilling.
- **benstoltz:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25
- **Eden:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual_of_the_Calling_of_an_Engineer
- **ahl:** Oxide challenge coins!
- **Dignissi:** Perhaps a ring buffer?
- **shandrew:** Count me in for a challenge coin!
- **DanCrossNYC:** Challenge coins are a military thing.
- **Nahum:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge_coin
- **DanCrossNYC:** Oorah!
- **AaronW:** https://twitter.com/beaker/status/414894015926902785?s=46
- **DanCrossNYC:** https://terminallance.com/2010/04/06/terminal-lance-27-challenge-coins-not-a-grunt-thing/
- **alilleybrinker:** It would be fun to go through the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) view for "Weaknesses in Software Written in C" and then characterize exactly which ones Rust stops: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/658.html
- **mxshift:** Taps "CVEs are a communications and coordination tool, not a quality metric" sign
- **Nahum:** https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/coin-check/ was a great episode on challenge coins.
- **shandrew:** Our ‚Äúmoving Flickr out of yahoo‚Äù challenge coin https://flic.kr/p/2ogMSFg
- **Sevan:** https://twitter.com/MiodVallat/status/519065338898837505
- **meta:** thank you yael!!
"- **a172:** I pulled this up thinking it may be a good basis for a coin design. I don't think that's actually the case, but it is cool and people here might like it:
