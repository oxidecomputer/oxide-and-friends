## Memory Safety with Yael Grauer

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://mastodon.social/@bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://mastodon.social/@ahl),
we were joined by special guest
[Yael Grauer](https://mastodon.social/@yaelwrites),
and [Steve Klabnik](https://twitter.com/steveklabnik).

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

If we got something wrong or missed something, please file a PR!
