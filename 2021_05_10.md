## A Requiem for SPARC with Tom Lyon

We've been holding a Twitter Space weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour.
In addition to [@bcantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill) and
[@ahl](https://twitter.com/ahl), speakers included
special guest [Tom Lyon](https://twitter.com/aka_pugs)
plus [Joshua Clulow](https://twitter.com/jmclulow),
[Dan McDonald](https://twitter.com/kebesays),
[Dan Cross](https://twitter.com/dancrossnyc),
[Tom Killalea](https://twitter.com/tomk_),
[Theo Schlossnagle](https://twitter.com/postwait),
[Antranig Vartanian](https://twitter.com/antranigv), and
[@perlhack](https://twitter.com/perlhack).

We recorded the space; [the recording is here](https://youtu.be/79NNXn5Kr90).

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- [@2:06](https://youtu.be/79NNXn5Kr90?t=126)
  SPARC [30th anniversary dinner](https://twitter.com/aka_pugs/status/1391238774978347010)
  > SPARC was an amazing achievement for its time,
  > but there were some nasty trade-offs made.
- [@2:56](https://youtu.be/79NNXn5Kr90?t=176)
  illumos [announcement][end support] on the end of
  [SPARC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARC) support
  - [SPARCstation 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARCstation_2)
- [@4:37](https://youtu.be/79NNXn5Kr90?t=277)
  "There is no photography allowed in the bring-up lab" story
  - [SPARCstation 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARCstation) (code-named Campus)
  > They bricked their first CPU..
- [@6:23](https://youtu.be/79NNXn5Kr90?t=383)
  [UltraSPARC-II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UltraSPARC_II) E-cache [parity error]
- [@8:51](https://youtu.be/79NNXn5Kr90?t=531)
  [Register windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_window)
  > Most people don't know, about that first SPARC,
  > there was no integer multiply or divide.. \
  > It would trap on the instructions.

  > I feel so decadent, I've just been sprinkling multiplications
  > around my code for years.

  popc instruction (also called [Hamming Weight])
  - [IBM Stretch] 1961, and the one-of-a-kind [IBM Harvest] made for the NSA
  - Henry Warren's 2002 [Hacker's Delight] Ch. 5 shows a ~20 instruction
    algorithm (no branches, only adds/shifts/masks by constants)
  > Warren: According to computer folklore, the population count function is important to the
  > National Security Agency. No one (outside of NSA) seems to know just what they use it for,
  > but it may be in cryptography work or in searching huge amounts of material.
  - According to [Agner Fog](https://www.agner.org/optimize/),
    [Ice Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Lake_(microprocessor))
    performs `popcnt` with a 3 cycle latency, and
    [Zen 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_3) with just 1 cycle latency.
  - Phil Bagwell's 2001 [Ideal Hash Trees] depend on pop count
  > Bagwell: Note that the performance of the algorithm is seriously impacted
  > by the poor execution speed of the POPCT emulation in Java, a problem
  > the Java designers may wish to address.
    - Persistent versions of Bagwell's trees are used for the
      built-in hash maps of Clojure, and in libraries for Scala etc.

  > those register windows to memory to be able to recover the stack trace.
  - [@14:30](https://youtu.be/79NNXn5Kr90?t=870)
    [Delay slot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_slot)

  > be to have a branch that executed right after a branch.

    on a VAC conflict (virtual address cache)
