# Oxide and Friends: September 22nd, 2025

## Systems Software in the Large

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording](https://youtu.be/rrgp4WXnA5Y).

Dave Pacheco is leading Oxide's multi-year effort around full-system update. He recently gave a talk about his experience leading that project, the complexities of designing the system and organizing the team. Dave, Bryan, and Adam discuss the project, the many sources of leadership, and the often underestimated peril of "organizational procrastination".

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://bsky.app/profile/bcantrill.bsky.social) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://bsky.app/profile/ahl.bsky.social),
we were joined by Oxide colleague,
[Dave Pacheco](https://hachyderm.io/@dap).

The idea for Rendezvous tables fell out of a meeting about pruning blueprint resources involving Sean Klein, Andrew Stone, John Gallagher, Rain Paharia, and Dave Pacheco on Jan 8, 2025. The meeting itself was a result of a [github issue](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/issues/7319). We were trying to figure out how systems outside of reconfigurator could properly clean up their own resources if the blueprint no longer contained information and they were reading directly from the blueprint tables. We decided, after 2+ hours of discussion to end up decoupling the data needed for external systems into separate tables so that those systems wouldn't need to know blueprint/reconfigurator internals. Andrew coined the term "Rendezvous Tables" for this idea because it seemed somewhat analagous to a [rendezvous channel](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.channels/-channel/-factory/-r-e-n-d-e-z-v-o-u-s.html) in that data was being handed off before it could be removed from the source.


If we got something wrong or missed something, please file a PR!
