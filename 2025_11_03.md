# Oxide and Friends: November 3rd, 2025

## Futurelock

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording](https://youtu.be/cqpLGvalyrI).

We're big users of async Rust at Oxide, and recently we found (another) very odd and hard to debug pathology related to async Rust that we dubbed "Futurelock". Oxide engineers who diagnosed the problem join Bryan and Adam to describe Futurelock and discuss methods to identify and avoid it.

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://bsky.app/profile/bcantrill.bsky.social) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://bsky.app/profile/ahl.bsky.social),
speakers included our Oxide colleagues
[Dave Pacheco](https://hachyderm.io/@dap),
[John Gallagher](https://hachyderm.io/@nerdyjkg),
[Rain Paharia](https://bsky.app/profile/sunshowers.io).
[Sean Klein](https://hachyderm.io/@smklein),
and [Eliza Weisman](https://bsky.app/profile/elizas.website).
