# Oxide and Friends: December 1st, 2025

## Death by Uptime

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording](https://youtu.be/JFtCJVxuug8).

We hit a new (and disturbing!) failure mode recently when a production rack
that had been up for several months saw every (!) compute sled's service
processor become simultaneously unresponsive. Bryan and Adam were joined by the
members of the Oxide team who debugged the vexing issue -- and reached its
surprising root cause.

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://bsky.app/profile/bcantrill.bsky.social) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://bsky.app/profile/ahl.bsky.social),
we were joined by Oxide colleagues,
[Cliff Biffle](https://hachyderm.io/@cliffle),
[Matt Keeter](https://hachyderm.io/@mjk),
and Will Chandler.
