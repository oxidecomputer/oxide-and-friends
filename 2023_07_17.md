# Oxide and Friends: July 17th, 2023

## The Frontend of the Computer

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording from July 17th, 2023](https://youtu.be/dS7TEfKqQY0).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://mastodon.social/@bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://mastodon.social/@ahl),
we were joined by Oxide colleagues
[David Crespo](https://hachyderm.io/@davidcrespo),
and [Justin Bennett](https://pkm.social/@just_be).

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- [Topic](link)

  *Leventhal's Conundrum*
- PRs needed!

If we got something wrong or missed something, please file a PR!
Our next show will likely be on Monday at 5p Pacific Time on our Discord
