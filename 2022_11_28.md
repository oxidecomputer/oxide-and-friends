# Oxide and Friends: November 28th, 2022

## Leaving Twitter with Tim Bray

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording from November 28th, 2022](https://youtu.be/GZF96XmmJg8).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://mastodon.social/@bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://mastodon.social/@ahl),
our special guest was
[Tim Bray](https://mastodon.cloud/@timbray).
Other speakers on November 28th included
[Adam Jacob](https://hachyderm.io/@adamhjk),
[Toasterson](),
and [raggi]().
(Did we miss your name and/or get it wrong? Drop a PR!)

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- [@1:20](https://youtu.be/GZF96XmmJg8?t=80) *Tim led the charge in blogging 20 years ago*
- short form is different from blogging, particularly around contemporaneous conversations
- [Bye, Twitter](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2022/11/26/Bye-Twitter) by Tim Bray
- [@14:24](https://youtu.be/GZF96XmmJg8?t=864) *Ad-driven model*
- Engagement vs enragement
- [Best of dying Twitter](https://twitter.com/bestofdyingtwit)
- Tim Bray [On Algorithms](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2022/11/28/On-Algorithms)
- On terrible Twitter ads: [@intelnews: "Moore’s Law only stops when innovation stops.”](https://twitter.com/intelnews/status/1579366123421810689)
- [@34:00](https://youtu.be/GZF96XmmJg8?t=2040) *better moderation - can't we all just get along?*
- Mastadon currently weaker than Twitter on the moderation standpoint, particularly damaging to minorities and women
- [jwz: Mastodon stampede](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2022/11/mastodon-stampede/)  _"Federation" now apparently means "DDoS yourself."_
- World class SREs looking after hachyderm, and it's not going well
- Ceding ground on Twitter ensures the hellscape everyone detests
- German government has official Mastadon instances
- The feeds are bad business.  The value is curation, federating protocols could open this up
- [jwz: PSA: Do Not Use Services That Hate The Internet](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2022/11/psa-do-not-use-services-that-hate-the-internet/)
- [@1:08:33](https://youtu.be/GZF96XmmJg8?t=4113) *geeky stuff*
- Mastodon has a nice [API](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/api/)
- [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) is pretty simple as a spec
- Masdtadon-alike options available on platforms other than Ruby-on-Rails, like [Pleroma](https://pleroma.social/)
