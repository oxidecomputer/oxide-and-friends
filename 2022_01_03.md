# Oxide and Friends Twitter Space: January 3rd, 2022

## Predictions 2022

We've been holding a Twitter Space weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour.
Even though it's not (yet?) a feature of Twitter Spaces, we have been
recording them all; here is
[the recording for our Twitter Space for January 3rd, 2022](https://youtu.be/uZylf2gbg_E).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://twitter.com/ahl),
our special guest on January 3rd included was tech prediction expert and noted Red Sox fan
[Steven O'Grady](https://twitter.com/sogrady).

Below is a table of the oracles and their predictions:
(If you made predictions, please submit a PR to add or clarify yours)

Smart glasses become a viable alternative for computer monitors
[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpAYtS_vl40). People who used to look
away from their phones to have their own thoughts, and are now using smart
glasses in real life situations, are subjected to an ads vs. attention "Tragedy
of the commons". As costs per unit decrease leading to ubiquity, this forces a
modern-day "[Highway Beautification
Act](https://www.lbjlibrary.org/news-and-press/media-kits/highway-beautification-act)"
to legislate Ad Blocking.

<td>
A significant percentage of commercial office space will be converted to housing.
</td>
<td>
The best AIs have emotional problems. We don't really know how they work. AI
specialists are more therapists than programmers.

</td>
<td>
Multiple companies will have demonstrated a AGI (one shot machine learning
system). It's not gonna be useful for anything, but I think the problem is less
hard than many critics think it is and several companies/organizations are
actually going to be showing the first versions of these systems.
</td>
<td>
Drones autonomously flying around private properties will be a common thing.
Factory managers, powerlines inspectors, large building sites etc. will have
commonly available and affordable options to inspect or patrol their
properties.
</td>
<td>
Web3 will actually happen, but not in the way it's currently being talked
about. In 6 years time bots will have improved to the point that they can not
be warded off the major platforms (or any platforms) and will make the web
absolutely unusable due to them disrupting all established crowd funded
moderation systems. A new paradigm will have to emerge that fundamentally
changes how we use the web (thus web3), so that we can still derive value from
it.

web3 is done; we're not talking about it, it's not a thing, we don't use the
term and we only vaguely recall what it was supposed to mean.
</td>
<td>
Productivity per watt becomes a highly important metric in computing. Tools
tell us about our power use. We spin workloads up and down depending on power
cost and availability.
</td>

AWS offers RISC-V instance types.

</td>
<td>
  Single-node computing: people will realize that that distributed computing has
  a lot of overhead and that one server can do a lot of work. This will lead
  people to people doing business analytics jobs by pulling all their data to a
  single a computer and doing the calculation, getting the result 100x faster
  than splitting data over many computers.
</td>
<td>
  Microservices inlining: taking a lot of microservices and statically linking
  them together. This will enable calling functions without network overhead,
  making things run 100x faster.
</td>
<td>
  We will start do scaling properly. Instead of thinking "how can I make this
  big data and scale up to infinity", we will try to get the most out of single
  node. Only once a single node has been pushed to its limit will we scale up to
  first a rack, then a datacenter, and then the world.
