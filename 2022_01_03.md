# Oxide and Friends Twitter Space: January 3rd, 2022

## Predictions 2022

We've been holding a Twitter Space weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour.
Even though it's not (yet?) a feature of Twitter Spaces, we have been
recording them all; here is
[the recording for our Twitter Space for January 3rd, 2022](https://youtu.be/uZylf2gbg_E).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://twitter.com/ahl),
our special guest on January 3rd included was tech prediction expert and noted Red Sox fan
[Steven O'Grady](https://twitter.com/sogrady).

Below is a table of the oracles and their predictions:

</td>
<td>
Multiple companies will have demonstrated a AGI (one shot machine learning system). It's not gonna be useful for anything, but I think the problem is less hard than many critics think it is and several companies/organizations are actually going to be showing the first versions of these systems.
</td>
<td>
Drones autonomously flying around private properties will be a common thing. Factory managers, powerlines inspectors, large building sites etc. will have commonly available and affordable options to inspect or patrol their properties.
</td>
<td>
Web3 will actually happen, but not in the way it's currently being talked about. In 6 years time bots will have improved to the point that they can not be warded off the major platforms (or any platforms) and will make the web absolutely unusable due to them disrupting all established crowd funded moderation systems. A new paradigm will have to emerge that fundamentally changes how we use the web (thus web3), so that we can still derive value from it.

web3 is done; we're not talking about it, it's not a thing, we don't use the
term and we only vaguely recall what it was supposed to mean.
</td>
<td>
Productivity per watt becomes a highly important metric in computing. Tools
tell us about our power use. We spin workloads up and down depending on power
cost and availability.
</td>
<td>
AWS offers RISC-V instance types.
