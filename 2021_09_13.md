recording them all; here is

  > which they'll want to pay to have a solution.

  > Tom: Was there actually a business anyways? Or was it just technology?

  > What if developers are attracted to those things they know cannot be monetized?

  > service level API and Docker technically had its own opinion about a
  > single API from a simplicity standpoint. We couldn’t agree.
  - DockerCon 2015: No mentioning Kubernetes!
    - Brendan Burns' talk "The distributed system toolkit: Container patterns for
      modular distributed system design" was unfortunately made private
      by [Docker](https://www.youtube.com/c/DockerIo) sometime in the last two years.
      The internet archive only has [this][burns-dockercon].
      Burns wrote a [blog post][burns-blog] about the topics from his talk.

    [CoreOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_Linux)
- [@36:11](https://youtu.be/l9LTJdT0sZ8?t=2171) Docker coming to market
  - Enterprise teams wanted support
  - Initial support offerings were expensive and limited
    (no after hours, no weekends)
  > Bryan: I floated to Solomon in 2014: run container management as a service.
  - [Rancher Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rancher_Labs),

- Product market fit
  - Acquisitions
- [@1:04:42](https://youtu.be/l9LTJdT0sZ8?t=3882)
  Could the outcome have been materially different?
  - Who made money on Docker? Cloud companies? Developers?
  - VMware acquires [Heptio][heptio]
  - Who invented containers?
    - BSD Jails, Plan9 namespaces?
  - Tyler Tringas' [post](https://calmfund.com/writing/investment-memo-calm-fund-2)
