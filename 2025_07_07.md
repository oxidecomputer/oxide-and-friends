# Oxide and Friends: July 7th, 2025

## Adventures in Data Corruption

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording](https://youtu.be/Nq7ranhHXwA).

Two years ago, the Oxide team encountered data corruption during a fairly simple network data transfer. The ensuing debugging sessions uncovered a truly bizarre bug involving CPU speculation! Bryan and Adam were joined by colleagues John and Rain to discuss the discovery and circuitous hunt to track down the bug.

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://bsky.app/profile/bcantrill.bsky.social) and

speakers included
[John Gallagher](https://hachyderm.io/@nerdyjkg),
and
