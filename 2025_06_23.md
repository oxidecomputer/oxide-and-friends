# Oxide and Friends: June 23rd, 2025

## When `async` Attacks!

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording](https://youtu.be/ngOXUhaKXOE).

What happens when the Oxide API is slow? A podcast episode! More specifically,
one about how the team employed all manner of debugging techniques to track it
down to one obscure and configurable async runtime feature! Bryan and Adam were
joined by members of the team to talk about that journey and the tools we used
(and made!) along the way.

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://bsky.app/profile/bcantrill.bsky.social) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://bsky.app/profile/ahl.bsky.social),
we were joined by Oxide colleagues,
[Dave Pacheco](https://hachyderm.io/@dap),
[Eliza Weisman](https://bsky.app/profile/elizas.website),
and Augustus Mayo.
