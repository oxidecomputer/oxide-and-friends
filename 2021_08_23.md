# Oxide and Friends Twitter Space: August 23rd, 2021

## The episode formerly known as â„”

We've been holding a Twitter Space weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour.
Even though it's not (yet?) a feature of Twitter Spaces, we have been
recording them all; here is
[the recording for our Twitter Space for August 23rd, 2021](https://youtu.be/-ZRv6EHaQYM).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://twitter.com/ahl),
speakers on August 23rd included
[Neal Gompa](https://twitter.com/Det_Conan_Kudo),
[Tom Lyon](https://twitter.com/aka_pugs),
[Laura Abbott](https://twitter.com/openlabbott),
[Jeremy Tanner](https://twitter.com/Penguin),
[Matt Campbell](https://twitter.com/mw_campbell),
[Simeon Miteff](https://twitter.com/simeonmiteff)
and others.
(Did we miss your name and/or get it wrong? Drop a PR!)

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- Last week's [recording](https://youtu.be/hlQuF75L4TE) on
  "Showstopper" with author G. Pascal Zachary, and Jessamyn West.
- [Ashton-Tate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashton-Tate) history
  (there never was any Ashton, and dBASE II *was* the first version)
  - [dBASE IV][dbase4] was "slow, buggy" and didn't get fixed in a timely manner
  - Last week, Pascal mentioned that CEO
    [Ed Esber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashton-Tate#Ed_Esber)
    "in a fit of insanity admitted to me (a journalist) he didn't
     know how to use his company's own product!"
  - [Friday!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashton-Tate#Friday!)
    personal information manager, and
    [Sidekick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland_Sidekick) from Borland
    (like Google calendar for DOS)
- [@3:01](https://youtu.be/-ZRv6EHaQYM?t=181)
  Phrasing: operating program (vs operating system)
  - Steve Jobs 1992 MIT Sloan [talk](https://youtu.be/Gk-9Fd2mEnI) ~72mins
    on consultants, hiring people and leaving Apple
    (see [mit.edu][jobs-mit] summary)
  > Jobs: NeXTSTEP is not an operating system, it's an operating environment
  - July 5th [recording](https://youtu.be/2H9XQBdLB0Y) discussing NeXT.
    Randall Stross book: [Steve Jobs and the NeXT Big Thing][stross-next] (1993)
  > Mac OSX focused on user capabilities of the desktop environment,
    but they considered it one and the same with the operating system
- [@7:42](https://youtu.be/-ZRv6EHaQYM?t=462)
  Windows NT had "multiple personalities"
  > Adam: I was instantly transported to the 90's.
  > Bryan: I could hear Smashing Pumpkins playing on the radio.
  - Sun's [Spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_(operating_system)) OS
    was the [ne plus ultra](https://www.google.com/search?q=ne+plus+ultra)
    of this approach
  - [Mach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_(kernel)) microkernel,
    [GNU Hurd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Hurd),
    [Apple M1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M1),
  - Windows Subsystem for Linux
    [WSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux)
  > Adam: Docker takes static linking to the extreme and just ships everything
- [@12:40](https://youtu.be/-ZRv6EHaQYM?t=760) Microkernels
  > Simeon: (Oxide) is working on a microkernel for Hubis, tell us about that
  - [Minix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minix), and the
    [Tanenbaum-Torvalds][kernel-debate] 1992 microkernel vs monolithic debate
  - [QNX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QNX) Unix-like real-time OS
    - See ACM ByteCast interview with Rashmi Mohan, Bryan tells the
      [story](https://youtu.be/seFP7-KI2OI?t=405) ~3mins of coming to QNX after
      reading about it in the "Operating Systems Roundup" of Byte Magazine 1993
      (see also Bryan's blog [post][dtrace-qnx] and
       [remembering Dan Hildebrand](https://openqnx.com/node/298))
    - [L4 microkernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L4_microkernel_family)
    - The [QNX 1.44M demo disk][qnx-demo]
      - The GUI was called Photon.
  > Bryan: why would we not run this (QNX) absolutely everywhere?
  - [Oberon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberon_(operating_system)) OS.
    [Photon][photon] microGUI
- [@15:49](https://youtu.be/-ZRv6EHaQYM?t=949)
  Laura on writing a microcontroller operating system
  - Cliff Biffle's [website](http://cliffle.com/)
  - Microkernels, root of trust, embedded systems
  - There is very little (or no) dynamic memory allocation in Hubris.
  - [Tock](https://www.tockos.org/) multitasking embedded OS, and Bryan's
    "Tockilator: Deducing Tock execution flows from Ibex Verilator traces"
    [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPuELAzJyno&t=10534s) ~12mins
  - In Tock, dynamic program loading is central.
    Hubris functions as a security-minded service processor. The programs
    it will use are all known in advance; so dynamic loading (and the
    accompanying security concerns) can be left out.
  - Fit-to-purpose OSs
- [@24:19](https://youtu.be/-ZRv6EHaQYM?t=1459)
  "Ropy Rippy" and the growing pains of RISC-V
  - [OpenTitan](https://opentitan.org/),
    ARM [Cortex-M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_Cortex-M)
> When we set out to write Hubris, we spent a lot of time reading
> and learning what's out there.
  - QNX vs monolithic systems. QNX was robust against module failure,
    so bugs in modules were tolerable. At Sun, faults in a module
    were system faults, so bugs were unacceptable.
  - Memory protection. Stack growing into (and corrupting) data segment,
    hard to debug.
  - Stack corruption, a hit and run.
- [@32:39](https://youtu.be/-ZRv6EHaQYM?t=1959) Humor: Oxide `rustfmt` bot is named Ozymandias

    open source maintainers, communicating bugs and issues
- [@39:54](https://youtu.be/-ZRv6EHaQYM?t=2394) Fun QNX bug story
  - QNX wrote their own POSIX utilities, they wrote their own AWK
  - QNX [developers][qnx-devs], incl. Peter van der Veen
- [@43:00](https://youtu.be/-ZRv6EHaQYM?t=2580) How do you say...
  - [vi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi),
    [ed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_(text_editor))
  > Tom: Off with their eds!
  - [sed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed),
    [ps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ps_(Unix)),
