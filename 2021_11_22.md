# Oxide and Friends Twitter Space: November 22nd, 2021

## Talking Turkeys

We've been holding a Twitter Space weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour.
Even though it's not (yet?) a feature of Twitter Spaces, we have been
recording them all; here is
[the recording for our Twitter Space for November 22nd, 2021](https://youtu.be/U10SuAHV8kQ).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://twitter.com/ahl),
speakers on November 22nd included
[XXX](),
and [YY]().
(Did we miss your name and/or get it wrong? Drop a PR!)

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- [Topic](link)
- [@M:SS](link into recording)
  *Leventhal's Conundrum*
- PRs needed!

If we got something wrong or missed something, please file a PR!
Our next Twitter space will likely be on Monday at 5p Pacific Time; stay tuned
to our Twitter feeds for details.  We'd love to have you join us, as we
always love to hear from new speakers!
