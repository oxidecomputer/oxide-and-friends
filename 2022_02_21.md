  > Twilio CEO: Yes, it was a meme, but it's a great representation of our job.
  > There is no instruction book and no one is going to tell us how to do our work.
  > It's now woven into our culture and used as a cheeky, but encouraging reply to
  > those who email colleagues at Twilio asking how to do something.

  Conclusions
  - Adam: Get it right first, but it's not a lost cause if you don't.
  - Bryan: Look for value alignment in organizations you might want to join,
    it's tough to change course after the fact.
  - Matt: generous compensation has an effect on how closely one cares to scrutinize
    their organization's values ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
