# Oxide and Friends Twitter Space: July 26, 2021

## Agile + 20

We've been holding a Twitter Space weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour.
Even though it's not (yet?) a feature of Twitter Spaces, we have been
recording them all; here is
[the recording for our Twitter Space for July 26, 2021](https://youtu.be/3tp5EtPdPwY).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://twitter.com/ahl),
speakers on July 26 included
[Tom Lyon](https://twitter.com/aka_pugs),
[Tom Killalea](https://twitter.com/tomk_),
[Dan Cross](https://twitter.com/dancrossnyc),
[Aaron Goldman](https://twitter.com/aarondgoldman),
and others.
(Did we miss your name and/or get it wrong? Drop a PR!)

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- Al Tenhundfeld's [Agile at 20: The Failed Rebellion](https://www.simplethread.com/agile-at-20-the-failed-rebellion/)
- The Agile [Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)
- [@0:55](https://youtu.be/3tp5EtPdPwY?t=55) Adam's experiences
- From the Agile Manifesto [history](https://agilemanifesto.org/history.html)
  > The only concern with the term agile came from Martin Fowler
  > (a Brit for those who don’t know him) who allowed that
  > most Americans didn’t know how to pronounce the word 'agile'.
- [@8:06](https://youtu.be/3tp5EtPdPwY?t=486)
  > There's so much that is unstructured in the way we develop software,
  > that we are constantly seeking people to tell us how to do it.
  > The answer is it's complicated.
- Steve Yegge's [Good Agile, Bad Agile](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/09/good-agile-bad-agile_27.html)
  > So the consultants, now having lost their primary customer, were at
  > a bar one day, and one of them (named L. Ron Hubbard) said:
  > "This nickel-a-line-of-code gig is lame. You know where
  > the real money is at? You start your own religion."
  > And that's how both Extreme Programming and Scientology were born.
- [@9:15](https://youtu.be/3tp5EtPdPwY?t=555)
  [Edward Yourdon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Yourdon)
  - "Decline and Fall of the American Programmer"
    [book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_and_Fall_of_the_American_Programmer)
- [@10:26](https://youtu.be/3tp5EtPdPwY?t=626)
  "The principles are not all wrong. Some today even feel obvious."
  > There's also a lack of specificity, which gives one lots of opportunity
  > for faith healers to come in.
- [@14:43](https://youtu.be/3tp5EtPdPwY?t=883)
  "Something I found surprising about Agile was how rigid it became."
  - Dan's perils of personal tracking methodology
  - Sun's engineers connecting directly with customers
- The Agile Ceremonies. (an [ultimate guide](https://www.easyagile.com/blog/agile-ceremonies/))
  - Sprint Planning, Daily Stand-Up, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective
- [@20:48](https://youtu.be/3tp5EtPdPwY?t=1248)
  "I think we overly enshrine schedule estimation. If there are any unknowns
  it becomes really hard."
  > I think there's a Heisenberg principle at work with software:
  > you can tell what's in a release or when it ships, but not both.

    [Software Engineering Institude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Engineering_Institute)
  > Some people really benefit from the level of rigidity that is set out
  > by these processes. Prior to that, they just weren't having
  > these conversations with their sales team, product owners, etc.
  - Construction analogies, repeatability.
  - [Self-anchored suspension bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-anchored_suspension_bridge)
