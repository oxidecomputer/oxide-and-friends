[Reply All episode](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/z3hlwr)
"Is the Facebook Microphone On?"

> The truth is actually scarier, Facebook doesn't *need* the mic to

The 2016 documentary "Silicon Cowboys" follows the rise of the Compaq computer company.
([IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4938484/))
([Watch the trailer](https://youtu.be/wjE6X0HZClc) ~3mins)

> Fastest to one billion in revenue... fastest to Fortune 500...
> a meteoric rise

### Open by Canion
[@7:05](https://youtu.be/faY7kWHQuNE?t=425)
The 2013 book ["Open"](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Open/CfStAAAAQBAJ)
by Rod Canion (cofounder and CEO of Compaq):
"How Compaq Ended IBM's PC Domination and Helped Invent Modern Computing."

[@10:02](https://youtu.be/faY7kWHQuNE?t=602)
Steve: Ben Rosen was the venture capitalist who wrote the first check
to Compaq, really got them off the ground. On the board for 20 years.

> Their timing was right. The way they did the company was right.
> And they executed really really well.

> To go from zero to 50 thousand units, of almost anything,
> in the time span they did, is incredible.

Tom: The thing that really put them on the map was having the portable
when nobody else did. And being 100% compatible.

> Those portables were barely luggable, they were huge!

> Back in a time when there was no network.
> Being able to pick up your computer and take it to a place,
> _was_ your network.

[@16:47](https://youtu.be/faY7kWHQuNE?t=1007)
Steve: A big catalyst for their success was _the channel_.
People were able to pick it up and go, they didn't need special training.

[@19:25](https://youtu.be/faY7kWHQuNE?t=1165)
Dad used to bring home the luggable so I could play
Space Invaders, and he would work on spreadsheets.

### Portable before Compaq
[@20:49](https://youtu.be/faY7kWHQuNE?t=1249)
There were portable solutions before Compaq, but for timesharing.

> You had the [T.I. Silent 700](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_700),
> in the 70's, you could tote that home and plug it into the modem.

### Osborne Effect
[@22:41](https://youtu.be/faY7kWHQuNE?t=1361)
Tom: They killed their company with the famous
[Osborne Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_effect)

> Bryan and Steve (clearly excited): What was the Osborne Effect!? \
> Tom: Pre-announcing the next machine.

> Telling customers: man, if you love the Osborne 1,
> just wait till the Osborne 2... So they did!

[@24:40](https://youtu.be/faY7kWHQuNE?t=1480)
Bryan: Something I found surprising about the history of
Compaq was the different organizational approach that they had.
 
> Early on, before even thinking about what to go do,
> they were talking about the kind of company they wanted to build.

### PBS Silicon Valley
[@26:14](https://youtu.be/faY7kWHQuNE?t=1574)
The 2013 PBS documentary "Silicon Valley" tells the story of
Fairchild Semiconductor.
([Watch chapter one](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/silicon-chapter-one/) ~17mins)

[@28:14](https://youtu.be/faY7kWHQuNE?t=1694)
We ask people, when they apply to Oxide, when they've been
most unhappy in their careers. And it all boils down to
people not feeling listened to, not having agency.

### IBM's role
[@29:41](https://youtu.be/faY7kWHQuNE?t=1781)
How much of Compaq's success is just pure mis-execution from IBM?
IBM inadvertently creates this pseudo open architecture,
and makes exactly the wrong move in trying to
[reproprietarize](https://youtu.be/Zpnncakrelk?t=1041)
it with the [PS/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PS/2) and
[Micro Channel architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Channel_architecture);
which is an absolute disaster.

> In many ways the story of Compaq is as much the story of
> the failed PS/2.

> It was such a mis-execution to do this analysis on the market
> and say: we need to grab our existing customers and lock them in,
> before they slip through our fingers, and in doing so,
> just hasten their departure. \
> And Compaq was in the right spot to pick up the pieces.

[MCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Channel_architecture) (Micro Channel architecture),
[ISA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_Standard_Architecture),
[EISA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Industry_Standard_Architecture)

[@33:22](https://youtu.be/faY7kWHQuNE?t=2002)
We were ripping out a bunch of ISA and EISA drivers..

> *I* am a sacrificial sheep, I can't possibly go.
> *You* are a sacrificial lamb.

> The machines themselves are anemic,
> if you want any functionality you go to a third party.. \
> There were magazines filled with advice on which
> sound-generating card you should buy.

[@40:20](https://youtu.be/faY7kWHQuNE?t=2420)
Speaking of Intel, a big part of the Compaq story is
what happens with the [386](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I386).

> IBM clearly thought Intel would never give some clone manufacturer
> the first rights to the 386. 

> They went from fast follower to innovator.

[OS/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/2) supported both
16 bit (for the [286](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80286)) and 32 bit. 

[@42:07](https://youtu.be/faY7kWHQuNE?t=2527)
One of the headwinds working against IBM was that all the
software companies wanted to see more competition in hardware
vendors; they wanted to see the clones become real companies.

> Certainly Microsoft aided the rise of Compaq, no question.
> Compaq turned Microsoft into a real believer.

### 80's Ads
[@43:11](https://youtu.be/faY7kWHQuNE?t=2591)
I loved the 80's ads.

John Cleese: [Compaq Portable vs a Fish](https://youtu.be/RlmzwZXa-Ww) ~2mins

> Cleese: I suppose the fish could *give* you a mega-bite!
> (laughs hysterically)

> Cleese: The Compaq Portable 2 however can run all IBM's most popular
> software, 30% faster than IBM can! \
> (dryly) HA HA HA

Bryan: Absolutely no joke, I knew Charlie Chaplin *first* through the
IBM PC ads. I didn't even know they were making a reference!

IBM Charlie Chaplin [ads compilation](https://youtu.be/kQT_YCBb9ao) ~9mins.
(Aside: these are new to me. For me it painted the computers as accessible/approachable,
something anyone could do; even a clumsy Mr. Bean character)

> You guys need to stop mocking the Chaplin ads. They were marketing gold
> and as a 5 year old watching bunny rabbit ear TV seeing those ads in
> the middle of Scooby Doo, I was begging my parents for an IBM PC!

[@47:10](https://youtu.be/faY7kWHQuNE?t=2830)
Adam: My parents got a free [Mac Plus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Plus)
when they opened a bank account! I know it's crazy anachronistic. 

> Adam: In '86 we had a [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64)
> and then upgraded to a Mac Plus. \
> Bryan: That's a big upgrade!
> Adam: It was incredible.

### Compaq and iPhone?
[@50:59](https://youtu.be/faY7kWHQuNE?t=3059)
Book and documentary ask: What if Compaq had made the iPhone?

> I think it cheapens the whole thing. No one should feel an
> obligation to claim their role in history by connecting themselves
> to the iPhone. The iPhone is not the pinnacle of human history.

> Just take your wins, and there are many of them.
> But, the time that they were dominant, *that's* the story.

### Decline and Acquisition
[@53:24](https://youtu.be/faY7kWHQuNE?t=3204)
The movie ends when Canion is fired, by Rosen, which is pretty amazing.

> To be fair, [DEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation) killed DEC.

[Tandem Computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandem_Computers)

> I feel like the later history of Compaq is this sugar high of sales
> continuing to spike, but then ultimately it's the ruin of the company.
> The company ceased to be an innovator.

[Compaq is acquired by Hewlett-Packard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compaq#Acquisition_by_Hewlett-Packard)

> Compaq systems, at this point, were very expensive. And this was part of the
> controversy of Rod getting run out, was not wanting to go down market.

[@59:51](https://youtu.be/faY7kWHQuNE?t=3591) 
Speaking of HPE (Hewlett Packard Enterprise)
and Compaq, they just relocated their headquarters to Huston.

> I feel like HP hasn't been a Silicon Valley company in a long long time.

> This was like the animals walking upright, where Compaq became a lot like
> IBM in a lot of their sales tactics.

### Something Ventured
[@1:02:41](https://youtu.be/faY7kWHQuNE?t=3761)
The 2011 documentary "Something Ventured" investigates the emergence
of American venture capitalism.
([Watch the trailer](https://youtu.be/ssR0sdKqNs4) ~2mins)
([Watch the documentary](https://vimeo.com/105745528) ~85mins)

[Tandem Computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandem_Computers)

> A 7 million dollar iceberg sitting in the datacenter, this Tandem.
> They were so reliant on it, they had another shrink wrapped just sitting
> on the datacenter floor, in the event that the first one ever went out.

> [Jimmy Treybig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Treybig)
> is a super interesting character. Very iconoclastic engineer.

> I didn't realize that Tandem _made_ KP.
> If it weren't for Tandem, [Kleiner Perkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleiner_Perkins)
> wouldn't have risen as a VC firm.
> They went all-in on Tandem, and Tandem had an outsized result.
