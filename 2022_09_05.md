# Oxide and Friends Twitter Space: September 5th, 2022

## Potpourri: Product, Platform, Paravirtualization

We've been holding a Twitter Space weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour.
Even though it's not (yet?) a feature of Twitter Spaces, we have been
recording them all; here is
[the recording for our Twitter Space for September 5th, 2022](https://youtu.be/Xd9oIUItoAo).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://twitter.com/ahl),
speakers on September 5th included
[Simeon Miteff](https://twitter.com/simeonmiteff),
and [YY]().
(Did we miss your name and/or get it wrong? Drop a PR!)

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- PRs needed!

Our next Twitter space will likely be on Monday at 5p Pacific Time; stay tuned

always love to hear from new speakers!
