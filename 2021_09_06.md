# Oxide and Friends Twitter Space: September 6th, 2021

## Put the OS back in OSDI

We've been holding a Twitter Space weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour.
Even though it's not (yet?) a feature of Twitter Spaces, we have been
recording them all; here is
[the recording for our Twitter Space for September 6th, 2021](https://youtu.be/PVJfqjJJCkg).

speakers on September 6th included
