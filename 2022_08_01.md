# Oxide and Friends Twitter Space: August 1st, 2022

## Deep Tech Investing

We've been holding a Twitter Space weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour.
Even though it's not (yet?) a feature of Twitter Spaces, we have been
recording them all; here is
[the recording for our Twitter Space for August 1st, 2022](https://youtu.be/67sp1l_sDkw).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://twitter.com/ahl),
our special guests were
[Seth Winterroth](https://twitter.com/Sethwinterroth),
and [Ian Rountree](https://twitter.com/IanRountree).
Also [Steve Tuck](https://twitter.com/ahl) was there.

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- [Tackling Problems of Significance in Physical Industries](https://eclipse.vc/blog/tackling-problems-of-significance-in-physical-industries/) by Seth
- [A financial argument for deep tech](https://medium.com/cantos-ventures/a-financial-argument-for-deep-tech-2b01bf6e663a) by Ian 
- [@33:35](https://youtu.be/67sp1l_sDkw?t=2015) [Adam Jacob](https://twitter.com/adamhjk) of Chef joins and talks about "people are really bad at asking questions about what people want" in the hard tech space.
- [@38:04](https://youtu.be/67sp1l_sDkw?t=2284) Adam Jacob with advice on who to partner with:
 > Adam: "Go with thesis. You need to find people whose thesis for the fund and whose thesis for everything aligns with the thesis of what it is your're trying to build and they want to build that thesis with you."
