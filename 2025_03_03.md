# Oxide and Friends: March 3rd, 2025

## A Crate is Born

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording](https://youtu.be/BTdxuOwV1eY).

Bryan and Adam were joined by Oxide colleagues Andrew, Rain, and John to talk
about creating a general purpose crate for diffing structures. More generally,
how do you know when something new is needed? How do you know when the
investment of time to validate an idea is warranted? Software engineering is
hard! (And also: general enthusiasm for Rust macros.)

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://bsky.app/profile/bcantrill.bsky.social) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://bsky.app/profile/ahl.bsky.social),
we were joined by Oxide colleagues,
Andrew Stone,
[Rain Paharia](https://bsky.app/profile/sunshowers.io),
and [John Gallagher](https://hachyderm.io/@nerdyjkg).

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:
