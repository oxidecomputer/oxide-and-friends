# Oxide and Friends Twitter Space: October 3rd, 2022

## Engineering Incentives... and Misincentives

We've been holding a Twitter Space weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour.
Even though it's not (yet?) a feature of Twitter Spaces, we have been
recording them all; here is
[the recording for our Twitter Space for October 3rd, 2022](https://youtu.be/SU4WT5RZAPY).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://twitter.com/ahl),
speakers on October 3rd included
Ian,
Dan,
and Christopher.

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- [@02:30](https://youtu.be/SU4WT5RZAPY?t=150)
  *Google Stadia*
- [Google Stadia to be shut down](https://www.wired.com/story/google-stadia-shutting-down-phil-harrison/)
- Incentivising new and grand over important and persistent
- [@07:15](https://youtu.be/SU4WT5RZAPY?t=435)
  *Eng incentives*
- Is leveling (engineers) the original sin?
- People do whatever the culture rewards
- At Oxide, Demo Day drives behaviors.
- Adam posits that sales folks can be very driven toward maximizing their comp, engineers can be more complicated
- CEO pay and the outcomes that drives - they do what they're paid to do
- [@011:45](https://youtu.be/SU4WT5RZAPY?t=705)
  *Brian on the intrinsic motivation of being useful*
- retention packages motivate not leaving, and that's it
- [@014:45](https://youtu.be/SU4WT5RZAPY?t=885)
  *metrics that drive poor behavior*
- lines of code, bugs fixed
- Patents and disclosures, many of which were never "reduced to practice"
- [@018:45](https://youtu.be/SU4WT5RZAPY?t=1125)
  *rewarding public heroism over private competence*
- tying anything to comp makes this fraught because comp is seen as zero sum
- perverse incentives: size of org, the VP who loves to hire
- [@023:30](https://youtu.be/SU4WT5RZAPY?t=1125)
  *extrinsic vs intrinsic motivators*
- the pat on the head or the stranger using a crate you published - those are still extrinsic motivators
- that guy whose opinion you value calls your stuff "slick"
- Praise - the things you say cast a long shadow.  The cheapest thing you have to give matters so much
- [@028:20](https://youtu.be/SU4WT5RZAPY?t=1410)
  *respect*
- Respect of your peers can become a currency of its own - the key driver in academia (it's not money)
- Academic motivation in general
- Computer Science academics churn earlier now when compared to 20 years ago
- financial incentives in industry is great and industry does not hold a monopoly on providing freedom to pursue research
- romanticism for teaching at the college level
- Industrial research at Bell Labs brough us Unix, C, the LASER
- [@042:05](https://youtu.be/SU4WT5RZAPY?t=2525)
  *incentives at Google*
- At Google you had to demonstrate impact.  Easiest way was to launch
- Harder to demonstrate impact with maintenance
- [The Master and Margarita](https://www.amazon.com/Master-Margarita-Mikhail-Bulgakov/dp/0679760806)
- some very small change can be preventative of a large impactful outage later
- Postulate: Maintenance work should be promotable work
- a small bug can demonsrate how impactful small changes and correctness are in systems
- [xkcd Dependency comic](https://xkcd.com/2347/)
- It's important to fully understand failures
- Incentives and disincentives of technical post-mortems
- [@054:30](https://youtu.be/SU4WT5RZAPY?t=3270)
  *Executive compensation*
- Peoply vying to be the smartest person in the room breeds a culture of attacking others' ideas
- [Adam's **favorite** psychology experiment](https://youtu.be/meiU6TxysCg?t=78) involving fairness, monkeys, cucumber, and grapes
- Scarcity driving behavior
- [@1:03:30](https://youtu.be/SU4WT5RZAPY?t=3810)
