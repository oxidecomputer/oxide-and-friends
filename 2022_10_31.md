# Oxide and Friends Twitter Space: October 31st, 2022

## Open Source Firmware

We've been holding a Twitter Space weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour.
Even though it's not (yet?) a feature of Twitter Spaces, we have been
recording them all; here is
[the recording for our Twitter Space for October 31st, 2022](https://youtu.be/QAhHkz76NbI).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://twitter.com/ahl),
our special guests were
[Christian Walker](https://twitter.com/nablahero) and
[Philipp Deppenwiese](https://twitter.com/_zaolin_).
Other speakers included Lucas.

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- [@1:20](https://youtu.be/QAhHkz76NbI?t=80)
  *Time zones, coworking across the globe*
- a 12-hour time dfference is unworkable
- [Decline and Fall of the American Programmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_and_Fall_of_the_American_Programmer) - Terrible book
- [Open Source Firmware conference](https://www.osfc.io/)
- [@14:40](https://youtu.be/QAhHkz76NbI?t=880)
  *Firmware trajectory*
- It felt like firmware was going to be proprietary forever
- Things were a little open before, probably hit maximally proprietary around 2012
- [Bloomberg Super Micro story](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/years-later-bloomberg-doubles-down-disputed-supermicro-supply-chain-hack-story/)
- [Trammel Hudson's 'Modchips of the state' talk](https://trmm.net/Modchips/)
- [Spectre and Meltdown](https://meltdownattack.com/)
- Nested components and hidden cores and firmware hiding everywhere
- [SOCs, systems on a chip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip)
- [@29:30](https://youtu.be/QAhHkz76NbI?t=1770)
  *OSFF*
- [Open-Source Firmware Foundation](https://opensourcefirmware.foundation/)
- Adam's Linux Foundation shakedown story
- [Linux Foundation financials](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/460503801)
- [@40:40](https://youtu.be/QAhHkz76NbI?t=2440)
  *defining firmware*
- Requires a physical artifact, and that physical thing is what's being sold
- Awaiting watershed moment when everything flips from default closed to default open
- Hallmarks of budding success: One of the large closed-source vendors (AMI) trying to get into the open-source model
- Companies don't want to even document their firmware right now
- What open source means to the community is different than what it means to SOC vendors
- As a customer, you can make it part of your business case that you value open technology stacks, including firmware
- Vendors use the line "our customers aren't asking for this"
- Adam's SSD vendor conversation - going to be a long time to get that open, mumble mumble, something lawyers
- Making gains for some vendors meant "we started using Git" and also living indoors.
- Open sourcing firmware would reveal design decisions of the underlying hardware.  The open question is: do those decisions on their own represent any secret sauce?
- [Corporate Open Source Anti-patterns talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pm8P4oCIY3g)
- [@1:10:40](https://youtu.be/QAhHkz76NbI?t=4240)
  *licensing agreements preventing open sourcing*
- No one likes binary blobs, they should be as small as possible and as few as possible, but we need to accommodate them, or we'll get nothing.
- Getting involved with the OSFF - [Homepage](https://opensourcefirmware.foundation/), [Newsletter](https://lists.osfw.foundation/), [Slack Channel](https://slack.osfw.dev/)
- Could use a hand with organizational work, not just technical
