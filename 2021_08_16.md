# Oxide and Friends Twitter Space: August 16th, 2021

## The Showstopper Show

We've been holding a Twitter Space weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour.
Even though it's not (yet?) a feature of Twitter Spaces, we have been
recording them all; here is

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- G. Pascal Zachary's "Showstopper! The Breakneck Race to Create
  Windows NT and the Next Generation at Microsoft" [book][show]
- Tracy Kidder's "The Soul of a New Machine" [book][soul]
- [@0:46](https://youtu.be/hlQuF75L4TE?t=46) "The endless debate of NT vs Unix."
  - Bryan: My whole career was kind of defined by going where Windows wasn't.
    I don't know what I was expecting, but what I found was a real time capsule
    from software development in the 90's.
- [@2:46](https://youtu.be/hlQuF75L4TE?t=166) Jessamyn: There was some familial
  impact (from developing DG Eclipse) that wasn't mentioned in the book.
  - "O, Engineers!" retrospective from [wired][wired]
- [@6:30](https://youtu.be/hlQuF75L4TE?t=390) What was Kidder's process?
  "He lived in my house!"
- [@8:32](https://youtu.be/hlQuF75L4TE?t=512)
  Zachary interviewed family members extensively.
  > People couldn't leave, they were staying at the office all the time.
- [@14:23](https://youtu.be/hlQuF75L4TE?t=863) I do feel this is a time capsule.
  A time before two mega-trends hit: the Internet and open source.
- [@17:33](https://youtu.be/hlQuF75L4TE?t=1053) Microsoft was kind of a joke software
  company in the early 90's.
  > Dave Cutler was a force of nature.
- [@19:59](https://youtu.be/hlQuF75L4TE?t=1199) No one understood why someone
  was good at coding. It was a mystery to everyone, why there was such a wide
  stratification of coders.
  > There were projects that never saw the light of day.
  - [Ashton-Tate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashton-Tate),
    [dBase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBase)
  > There was a sense from Cutler and Perazzoli, that leadership of the team,
  > that these guys at Microsoft really didn't get how serious the process
  > of building this battleship was.
  - I think the level of anguish did surprise me.
- [@23:59](https://youtu.be/hlQuF75L4TE?t=1439)  
  In "Soul of the New Machine," the machine was the star, and people served it.
  East Coast vs West Coast attitudes.
  > On the West Coast, the personal computer were supposed to help you
  > actualize your counter-cultural values.
  - [Ken Olsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Olsen) of
    [DEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation)
  > Computing is equivalent with IBM. There was no software industry
  > so long as IBM gave all the software away for free.
- [@26:09](https://youtu.be/hlQuF75L4TE?t=1569) Crashes.
  > [Wozniak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak) dreamed of owning
  > his own [PDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_Data_Processor)
  > computer, which cost as much as a house. So he was aware of the robustness
  > of the minicomputer, and by contrast, the puny power of a personal computer.
  - [Thirtysomething](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirtysomething)
  > Dave Cutler was not cuddly. He was menacing, he could lose his temper.
  > And I tried not to get to close to him physically for that reason.
  > There were two looming father figures in Cutler and Gates.
  > And I think it created a lot of anxiety.
- [@29:52](https://youtu.be/hlQuF75L4TE?t=1792)
  The stakes for NT at Microsoft were high.
  - Fred Brooks' "The Mythical Man-Month"
    [book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month)
  > It was a watershed moment in the history of computing.
  > It was more like the last battleship, rather than the next frontier.
  - Bryan: I didn't realize this, that Gates was arguing against memory
    protection with Cutler. From our perspective, shipping an operating
    system without memory protection, in an era when microprocessors
    supported it, is malpractice.
- [@33:14](https://youtu.be/hlQuF75L4TE?t=1994) Cutler's vendetta against Unix.
  > Conflict was at the heart of innovation at Microsoft at that time.
  - [Mitch Kapor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Kapor) of Lotus.
  > These early personal computer innovators were dismissed and sometimes
  > humiliated by mainstream big iron people of the 60's and 70's.
  - Bill Gates' "The Road Ahead"
    [book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_Ahead_(Gates_book))
    doesn't mention the internet.
  - Zachary's "Endless Frontier: Vannevar Bush, Engineer of the American Century"
    [book][bush]
  > Computers on the West Coast were seen as extensions of your creativity,
  > and a tool for liberation. And for a long time that dominated the horizons.

  > In 2005 Gates and [Ballmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Ballmer)
  > don't want to do cloud computing. "Who's gonna want to put their stuff
  > in the cloud?" We've found that computing is a collective experience.
- [@38:28](https://youtu.be/hlQuF75L4TE?t=2308) Email and personal messaging
  - [Sun Ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Ray) thin client computer
  - Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson's "The UNIX time-sharing system" [paper][unix]
  > Unix was an experiment in collaboration.
  - [RSX-11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSX-11) for the
    [PDP-11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11).
    And [VMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVMS) for the VAX.
  > The attitude of looking down on Unix (as undesigned, academic) is
  > carried forward by Microsofties today.
  - Tom: You can forgive Cutler's misgivings, because Unix pretty
    much stole the thunder out of VMS.
- [@42:24](https://youtu.be/hlQuF75L4TE?t=2544) Interviews for the book.
  Family members perspective on workplace behavior.
  - Betty Shanahan, Society of Women Engineers. Brief [Q&A][betty]

  - Jessamyn's "Women in Early Tech" [blog entry][women-tech] about Shanahan
- [@48:10](https://youtu.be/hlQuF75L4TE?t=2890) Where did these engineers end up?
  They are broadly no longer engineers. This project burned people out.
  - Short 1993 [article][short-art] by Zachary:
    "After two years in ship mode... a lot of people are angry, tired, and burned out."
  - Johanne Caron, [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johanne-caron-randolph-4ba97413)
  - Pascal: Kidder was like a fly on the wall. I was doing reconstruction
    as well as observation. I talked to family members to get the whole picture.
- [@53:20](https://youtu.be/hlQuF75L4TE?t=3200) Cutler got to run his own show.
  > Ken Olsen was like the [LBJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson)
  > of the computer industry: he's waist deep in the big money.
  - Corporate culture. Hotshot coders. Renegades, rebels, hero programmers.
  > It's the majesty and mystery of code writing, that there's such a wide
  > range of performance.
  - Pascal: I wasn't invited to the 25 year anniversary of the NT team..
- [@1:01:47](https://youtu.be/hlQuF75L4TE?t=3707) Journalists and companies.
  > Soul of a New Machine was very flattering to the company.
  - Jobs backdated stock options, in violation of clear federal law.
    Gates repeatedly stole things.
  > The hobbyists were a small market, Microsoft needed to sell to corporations.
  - Zachary's "Software, the Invisible Technology"
    2016 [essay](https://spectrum.ieee.org/software-the-invisible-technology)
  > Where we used to relate to programs, we now relate to services.

  > I think there needs to be a greater literature of software:
  > the making of it, its purpose, its vulnerabilities, its values.
  - Tom: It's because us practitioners are too embarrased about it all..
- [@1:05:49](https://youtu.be/hlQuF75L4TE?t=3949) Josh compares and contrasts.
  > Coders don't have to test their own stuff. The second stringers do that.
  - Pascal: I would encourage people to write more about software
    and how it's created.
  - Zachary's "Code Rush" [film](https://youtu.be/4Q7FTjhvZ7Y) ~56mins
    about Netscape.
- [@1:08:58](https://youtu.be/hlQuF75L4TE?t=4138) The rise of open source.
  Software as immutable artifact: once it's written, it's written.
  > Amazon, Google, Netflix are not possible without open source.
- [@1:10:50](https://youtu.be/hlQuF75L4TE?t=4250)
  Jessamyn on helping people use tech. Accessibility
  > I'm a service oriented person. I work with
  > people who are struggling with technology.
- [@1:15:24](https://youtu.be/hlQuF75L4TE?t=4524) Agency of users.
  > Bryan: Without memory protection, you would lose hours of work.
  > One bad application could cause the computer to reboot.
  - Open source tools, and user accessible scripting/modding.
  - Gary Larson's "The Far Side"
    [comic](https://images.app.goo.gl/fnrrdDDJtraefD769) "Blah blah blah Ginger"
  - Tweet [series](https://twitter.com/hadip/status/1426587396343099397)
    about Internet Explorer's 25 year anniversary
- [@1:22:01](https://youtu.be/hlQuF75L4TE?t=4921) Pascal's parting thoughts.
  > The transformation of software from artifact into service,
  > is both fabulous and also scary. It changes all the time.
  > When NT was done, it was a fixed unchanging thing.
  - Bryan: The darker side to services is people need to attend to
    it whenever it breaks.
  - Adam: It's the death march with no end.
  > Pascal: Thanks everyone, I'd love to hear from you individually.
  > I'm interested in why people continue to turn to Showstopper
  > and find some value in it.
  - Pascal: I encourage you to think about the literary aspects of software.
    I think it's valuable for society and civilization, for our culture,
    because there really is an artistic, artisanal side to software.
    Thanks again for including me.
