We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is

Oxide raised a truckload of capital a few weeks ago to fund the business for the foreseeable future. Bryan and Steve describe the raise, and Adam poses the best the best (and worst) questions scraped from Hacker News.

In addition to

we were joined by Oxide CEO,
