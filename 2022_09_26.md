# Oxide and Friends Twitter Space: September 26th, 2022

## Losing the Signal with Sean Silcoff (The Rise and Fall of BlackBerry)

We've been holding a Twitter Space weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour.
Even though it's not (yet?) a feature of Twitter Spaces, we have been
recording them all; here is
[the recording for our Twitter Space for September 26th, 2022](https://youtu.be/68TVcHeBsBU).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://twitter.com/ahl),
our esteemed guest was one of the authors of Losing the Signal,
[Sean Silcoff](https://twitter.com/SeanSilcoff).

Not many links, mostly anecdotes from [Losing the Signal: The Untold Story Behind the Extraordinary Rise and Spectacular Fall of BlackBerry](https://www.amazon.com/Losing-Signal-Extraordinary-Spectacular-BlackBerry-ebook/dp/B00Q20ASVS), the book Sean co-wrote with Jacquie McNish

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- [@05:01](https://youtu.be/68TVcHeBsBU?t=301)
  *The aha moment for BBM*
- [@09:42](https://youtu.be/68TVcHeBsBU?t=582)
  *Ruffled feathers from partner interactions*
  + Bell South thought they had an exlusive deal and they didn't
  + Years later, people didn't seem to hold it against them
- [@12:40](https://youtu.be/68TVcHeBsBU?t=760)
  *Brian's anecdote about a meeting with Balsillie and Lazaridis*
- [@15:30](https://youtu.be/68TVcHeBsBU?t=930)
  *Lost opportunities to course-correct*
  + The touch screen button
- [@20:00](https://youtu.be/68TVcHeBsBU?t=1200)
  *The Blackberry Storm*
  + Potentially rushed to market when it was not up to standards
  + RIM's own testing lab found serious problems but shipped it anyway
  + RIM was a great innovator and a terrible follower, some have said that of Apple, though
- [@25:40](https://youtu.be/68TVcHeBsBU?t=1540)
  *Lazaridis as the product guy*
  + This I get (keypad), this I don't get (touchscreen)
  + Story on the way up is as important as on the way down
- [@30:20](https://youtu.be/68TVcHeBsBU?t=1820)
  *Parallels with DEC*
  + Amazing rise
  + Failure to pass control
  + co-CEO model at RIM - worked really well until it didn't
- [@34:19](https://youtu.be/68TVcHeBsBU?t=2059)
  *NTP Patent case*
  + [Case brief](https://www.lexisnexis.com/community/casebrief/p/casebrief-ntp-inc-v-research-in-motion-ltd)
  + Jury selection was weighed incredibly far towards lay folks with very little technical understanding
  + Technical demonstration goes sideways
- [@45:10](https://youtu.be/68TVcHeBsBU?t=2710)
  *Trusting the other co-CEO and the option backdating scandal*
  + Lazaridis didn't really understand the options stuff and felt Balsillie had put the company at risk
  + Kept their fights private, but people could tell "mom and dad weren't getting along"
  + Is it right or wrong if everyone was doing it?
  + They left an extensive digital paper trail making it easy to make a case
  + Thanks to Tom for the clarification - options backdating was okay, failing to report it was not
- [@52:50](https://youtu.be/68TVcHeBsBU?t=3170)
  *Larry Conlee*
  + Fire and brimstone, had a pocket veto, spoke with the voice of the CEOs
  + Co COOs!
  + Carriers were afraid of becoming dumb pipes, so were anti-app store
  + Blackberry didn't care about doing an app store, then AT&T bent to Apple and allowed them to have an app store
  + RIM did not believe that Silicon Valley would be let in the front door at the carriers
  + RIM would talk about Apple as "the toy company" while being actively devoured

If we got something wrong or missed something, please file a PR!
Our next Twitter space will likely be on Monday at 5p Pacific Time; stay tuned
to our Twitter feeds for details.  We'd love to have you join us, as we
always love to hear from new speakers!
