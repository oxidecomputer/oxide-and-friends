# Twitter Space on May 3, 2021

We've been holding a Twitter Space weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour.
Even though it's not (yet?) a feature of Twitter Spaces, we have been
recording them all; here is
[the recording for our Twitter Space for May 3, 2021](https://youtu.be/h-WSU3kiXVg).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://twitter.com/ahl),
speakers on May 3rd included
[Laura Abbott](https://twitter.com/openlabbott),
[Nate](https://twitter.com/perlhack),
[Antranig Vartanian](https://twitter.com/antranigv),
[François Baldassari](https://twitter.com/baldassarifr),
[Tom Killalea](https://twitter.com/tomk_),
[Land Belenky](https://twitter.com/LBelenky),
and [Sid?]().
(Did we miss your name and/or get it wrong? Drop a PR!)

Before the recording started, we discussed:

- 2011 Solaris Family Reunion [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0591H_kHwo) ~20mins
- Katie Moussouris’s [blog entry][km-vul] on the Clubhouse vulnerabilities
- Laura's [blog entry][lcp55] on the LPC55 vulnerability
- Land pointing us to the Atmega 328p MCU in a BK Medical endorectal probe
- François on the STM32F103 found in Pebble
- [Intel Management Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Management_Engine)

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- [ASPEED BMC](http://www.aspeedtech.com/server_ast1050/) chip
- [[Listen 1:24]](https://youtu.be/h-WSU3kiXVg?t=84)
  So formal correctness is something that I think we are all very sympathetic with.
  > It's very laudable, it's also very hard.
  - From L3 to seL4 What Have We Learnt in 20 Years of L4 Microkernels?
    ([paper][l3-to-sel4])
  - Who guards the guards? Formal validation of the Arm v8-m architecture specification
    ([paper][who-guards])
  > Hardware architecture is an area where formal verification is more tenable,
  > a level you can readily reason about.
  
  > Our challenge is how can we satisfy our need for formalism without getting too
  > pedantic about it.
  > You don't want to lose the forest for the trees. \
  > A system we never deliver doesn't actually improve anyone's lives, that's the challenge.
- [[Listen 5:20]](https://youtu.be/h-WSU3kiXVg?t=320) Journal club experiences
  - Bootstrapping Trust in Modern Computers ([book][bootstrap-trust])
  > [[Listen 9:45]](https://youtu.be/h-WSU3kiXVg?t=585)
  > We've tried to build a culture of looking to other work that's been done.
  > Not because everything's been done before, but because you don't want to have to
  > relearn something that someone has already learned and talked about. \
  > If you can leverage someone's wisdom, that's energy well spent.
- [[Listen 11:46]](https://youtu.be/h-WSU3kiXVg?t=706)
  When systems repeat mistakes, engineers feel deprived of agency:
  "I suffered for nothing."
  > Engineering is this complicated balance between seeing the world as it could be,
  > and accepting the world as it is.
  > As you get older as an engineer, it's too easy to no longer see what could be,
  > and you get mired in the ways the world is broken. You can become pessimistic.
- Caitie McCaffrey on Distributed Sagas: A Protocol for Coordinating Microservices
  ([video][sagas] ~45min)
- [[Listen 14:17]](https://youtu.be/h-WSU3kiXVg?t=857)
  It's dangerous to live only in the future, detached from present reality.
  [Optative voice][optative]
- [[Listen 16:45]](https://youtu.be/h-WSU3kiXVg?t=1005)
  At Oxide, we ask applicants "when have you been happiest and why? Unhappiest?"
  Interesting to see that unhappy is all the same story:
  we were trying to do the right thing and management prevented it.
  > When I was younger and maybe more idealistic and willing to charge at the windmills,
  > I stayed too long with a company.
  > All the developers that interviewed me were gone by the time I got there.
  > I should have walked out the door, but I was too young and didn't know better.
- [[Listen 18:43]](https://youtu.be/h-WSU3kiXVg?t=1123)
  "How do you and your cofounder resolve conflicts?"
  > I don't want to hear about how you don't have conflicts, tell me about how you resolve them.
  
  > Folks aren't able to walk away, they've got
  > this commitment both to the work and to their colleagues. \
  > I've been a dead-ender a couple of times, I'll go down with the ship.
- [[Listen 20:28]](https://youtu.be/h-WSU3kiXVg?t=1228)
  In "Soul of a New Machine" ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Soul_of_a_New_Machine))
  Tom West says he wants to trust his engineers, but that trust is risk.
  > I just love that line: that trust is risk.
  > That's part of the reason some of these companies
  > have a hard time trusting their technologists,
  > they just don't want to take the risk.

  > People are so not versed in how to deal with conflict,
  > and there's nothing scarier than salary negotiation.

  > They need you, that's why you're here, you've made it all the way through the
  > interview to this point, you've got leverage, now's the time to use it.
- [[Listen 23:04]](https://youtu.be/h-WSU3kiXVg?t=1384)
  Oxide: [Compensation as a Reflection of Values][oxide-comp]
  > It takes the need for negotiation out,
  > because it replaces it with total transparency.
  
  > Sometimes it's not about what you're getting paid,
  > it's about what the other person is getting paid.
  > Not wanting to get taken advantage of.

  > It's a social experiment for sure.
- [[Listen 28:07]](https://youtu.be/h-WSU3kiXVg?t=1687)
  Steve Jobs famously tried this at NeXT: pay was transparent but _not_ equal.
  - History of compensation at NeXT ([wiki][next-wiki]) ([quora post][next-quora])
  > I think that's the worst of both worlds, a recipe for disaster.
