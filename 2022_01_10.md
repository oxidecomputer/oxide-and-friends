# Oxide and Friends Twitter Space: January 10th, 2022

## Flying Blind with Peter Robison

We've been holding a Twitter Space weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour.
Even though it's not (yet?) a feature of Twitter Spaces, we have been
recording them all; here is
[the recording for our Twitter Space for January 10th, 2022](https://youtu.be/q6i9NPslfE4).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://twitter.com/ahl),
our special guest was
[Peter Robison](https://twitter.com/petermrobison).

Other speakers on January 10th included
