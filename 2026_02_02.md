## Software Engineering Past, Present, and Future with Grady Booch

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording](https://youtu.be/McAL6jkRUO4).

Bryan and Adam were joined by Grady Booch, software engineering pioneer and
*living* legend, to speak about the past present and future of software
engineering. History doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme!

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://bsky.app/profile/bcantrill.bsky.social) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://bsky.app/profile/ahl.bsky.social),
we were joined by special guest
[Grady Booch](https://bsky.app/profile/booch.com).

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them (some LLM assistance):

- [**SAGE**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-Automatic_Ground_Environment) as foundational real-time distributed system  
- [Software crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_crisis) demand outpaced ability to build reliable systems  
- [**Margaret Hamilton**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(software_engineer)) (SAGE → Apollo) and the term “software engineering”  
- [**UML**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language)
- [Rational Software founded (1982); acquired by IBM (2003)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_Software)
- OO overshot via inheritance; core idea (objects as cognitive units) endured
- LLMs are unreliable narrators - they **cannot do abductive reasoning**
- Architecture = decisions with high cost of change
- Core skills persist: abstraction, coupling, cohesion, judgment
- Fear cycles repeat; fundamentals endure

## Grady's Book Recommendations

- [*The Sciences of the Artificial* — Herbert Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sciences_of_the_Artificial)
- [*Systemantics* - John Gall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemantics)
- [*The Mythical Man-Month* — Fred Brooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month)
- [*Refactoring* — Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html)

We'd love to have you join us, as we always love to hear from new speakers!
