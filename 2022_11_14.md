# Oxide and Friends Twitter Space: November 14th, 2022

## Mastodon with Kris Nova

We've been holding a Twitter Space weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour.
Even though it's not (yet?) a feature of Twitter Spaces, we have been
recording them all; here is
[the recording for our Twitter Space for November 14th, 2022](https://youtu.be/2YvLYUYKEAs).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://mastodon.social/@bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://mastodon.social/@ahl),
our special guest was
[Kris Nova](https://hachyderm.io/@nova).
Other speakers on November 14th included
[XXX](),
and [YY]().
(Did we miss your name and/or get it wrong? Drop a PR!)

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- Waiting for Twitter to technically collapse
- Running an experiment - what happens when you get rid of all of the SREs - how does it go down?
- If this were on [Silicon Valley](https://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley) this would be deemed lazy writing
- [@4:28](https://youtu.be/2YvLYUYKEAs?t=268)
  *Oxide and Friends is shopping around for new social audio space*
- will kick the tires on a few
- need: ability for lots of simultaneous listeners (thousands)
- need: dynamically have speakers join - key to the show
- see last week's layoff discussion around visas
- mental inventory - good about Twitter?
- serendipitous conversations
- getting engagement from those whose work you admire - great vibes
- not so good - pushed behavior to encourage a strive toward virality
- [@12:25](https://youtu.be/2YvLYUYKEAs?t=745)
  *Kris's experience with Mastadon*
- Decided to setup a hacker-centric Mastadon space to service some home-lab projects
- The history of new things on the internet is discomfort and pain - Email, Facebook, Docker
- That doesn't mean that all uncomfortable tech is the next big thing
- Timing is key - implosion of Twitter, economic state of the world, convergence of certain subset of a technology generation
- [@18:00](https://youtu.be/2YvLYUYKEAs?t=1080)
  *what is the fediverse*
- A lot like email, but with a neighborhood
- Your service provider is not a faceless megacorp, but it's a person
- What's the infrastructure like?
- [Kris on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/krisnova)
- grassroots/community conversations about how to best build and scale and store data, etc
- [Mastadon managed hosting](https://masto.host)
- Rust relay for ActivityPub under development
- Choosing a server is low-risk
- Choosing a server outside of the US is not necessarily low-risk - in countries affected by war for example, the ability to continue to communicate is a literal lifesaver
- [ActivityPub Wordpress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/)
- [decentralized photo sharing - Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org)
- What new features came to Twitter in the past 10 years?
- [@42:00](https://youtu.be/2YvLYUYKEAs?t=2520)
  *things to love coming from Twitter to Mastadon*
- Lack of an algorithm
- No quote tweets that allow you to be shitty
- Usable from the browser - no need for a dedicated app
- On the other hand, the apps are not that good
- [@48:10]
  *Mastadon is not the standard*
- There's confusion with the current content warning in the standard
- Dominant implementation will make and break features
- The duty of a moderator or admin is not to be the fediverse police
- Content warnings for discussions of race is one thing, autoplayed video of people getting killed is another
- In general, good discussion on Mastadon, no true discussion on Twitter
- The origin of the content warning is to prevent triggering PTSD when using social media
- Harder for a hot take to go viral on Mastadon, which is a good thing
- [@1:05:30](https://youtu.be/2YvLYUYKEAs?t=2520)
- [Pinafore Mastadon client](https://pinafore.social/)
- open protocol is no guarantee that someone implemented all the features
- on the other hand, there's interoperability across platforms
- much like emails, the name isn't unique, only unique per instance
- server-specific character limit
- [@1:16:14](https://youtu.be/2YvLYUYKEAs?t=4574)
  *How does this all become sustainably financed?*
- People are a lot of the costs of Twitter
- Human connections (and light company sponsorship) has kept things sustainable for now
- Paying for things that should be free is Anathema for a certain generation, led to advertisement model
- USAID providing funding for a Mastadon server in Armenia
- [@1:24:40](https://youtu.be/2YvLYUYKEAs?t=5080)
  *Bryan likes the impaired searchability of Mastadon*
- makes it hard to find something to go be mad about
- Coteries of specialists on Twitter have created some unique communities, many of them are moving
- [RSS to ActivityPub Converter](https://rss.friend.camp/)
