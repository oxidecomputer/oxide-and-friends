# Oxide and Friends Twitter Space: October 18th, 2021

## Dijkstra's Tweetstorm

We've been holding a Twitter Space weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour.
Even though it's not (yet?) a feature of Twitter Spaces, we have been
recording them all; here is
[the recording for our Twitter Space for October 18th, 2021](https://youtu.be/D-Uzo7M-ioQ).

speakers on October 18th included

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- Dijkstra's 1975 "How do we tell truths that might hurt?" [EWD 498](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/ewd498.html)

> new generation of coding bums
