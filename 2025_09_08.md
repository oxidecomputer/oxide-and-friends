# Oxide and Friends: September 8th, 2025

## Technological Revolutions with Jerry Neumann

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording](https://youtu.be/-jZXEsconl4).

Jerry Neumann joined Bryan and Adam to discuss his blog post from 2015, examining the work of Carlota Perez on technological revolutions. These waves have similarities, in particular: frenzy, bust, and deployment. Is AI a new wave or the culmination of the IT wave of the last 50 years?

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://bsky.app/profile/bcantrill.bsky.social) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://bsky.app/profile/ahl.bsky.social),
we were joined by special guest,
[Jerry Neumann](https://bsky.app/profile/ganeumann.bsky.social).

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- [Jerry's 2015 blog post: The Deployment Age](https://reactionwheel.net/2015/10/the-deployment-age.html)
