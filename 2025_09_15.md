# Oxide and Friends: September 15th, 2025

## Scaling Manufacturing

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording]().

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://bsky.app/profile/bcantrill.bsky.social) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://bsky.app/profile/ahl.bsky.social),
we were joined by Oxide colleagues,
CJ Mendes,
Kirstin Neira,
Erik Anderson,
Aaron Hartwig,
and Doug Wibben.

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- [Topic](link)
- [@M:SS](link into recording)
  *Leventhal's Conundrum*
- PRs needed!

If we got something wrong or missed something, please file a PR!
Our next show will likely be on Monday at 5p Pacific Time on our Discord
server; stay tuned to our Mastodon feeds for details, or [subscribe to this
