# Oxide and Friends: September 15th, 2025

## Scaling Manufacturing

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording](https://youtu.be/MhlR6JkGyDY).

Bryan and Adam were joined by members of the Oxide manufacturing team to talk about all that goes into ramping up production, from people and processes to expanding the team and refining inefficiencies. It's a great problem to have!

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://bsky.app/profile/bcantrill.bsky.social) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://bsky.app/profile/ahl.bsky.social),
we were joined by Oxide colleagues,
CJ Mendes,
Kirstin Neira,
Erik Anderson,
Aaron Hartwig,
and Doug Wibben.
