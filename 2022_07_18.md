# Oxide and Friends Twitter Space: July 18th, 2022

## Across the Chasm with Rust

We've been holding a Twitter Space weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour.
Even though it's not (yet?) a feature of Twitter Spaces, we have been
recording them all; here is
[the recording for our Twitter Space for July 18th, 2022](https://youtu.be/OqyqzFiP1P0).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://twitter.com/ahl),
our special guests were
[Steve Klabnik](https://twitter.com/steveklabnik) and
[Luqman Aden](https://twitter.com/luqma_).
Other speakers included
[Dan Cross](https://twitter.com/dancrossnyc),
[Tim McNamara](https://twitter.com/timClicks),
and [YY]().
(Did we miss your name and/or get it wrong? Drop a PR!)

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- [@0:27](https://youtu.be/OqyqzFiP1P0?t=27)
  *`let_chains` are stable in Rust 1.64*
  + [Adam's tweet](https://twitter.com/ahl/status/1548680684796911616)
  + [The stabilization PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/94927#event-7007028976), with the full saga leading up to stabilization
  + As Steve mentions, the feature dates [all the way back to 2017](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2260) and extends the [Swift-inspired `if let` expressions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/160) Rust has had for a while
  + Some Rust features, like [`async` functions in traits](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/3185-static-async-fn-in-trait.html), are [huge](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3185) rabbit [holes](http://www.smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2019/10/26/async-fn-in-traits-are-hard/)
  + Discussion about Rust's commitment to stability and how it's [enforced](https://brson.github.io/2017/07/10/how-rust-is-tested) with things like [`crater`](https://github.com/rust-lang/crater)
  + As an example of the _process_ leading to burnout in programming language communities: Guido [stepping down as BDFL](https://lwn.net/Articles/759654/) after [PEP 572](https://peps.python.org/pep-0572/) (Assignment Expressions, *"the walrus operator"*)
  + Discussion about Ruby also taking stability seriously: [`flip-flop`s](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/syntax/control_expressions_rdoc.html#label-Flip-Flop) [*weren't* removed in Ruby 2.0](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/5400) in part because of [this pretty incredible snippet](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/5400#note-3) from [Yusuke Endoh](https://github.com/mame)
  + [Quines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_%28computing%29) and [variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)#Ouroboros_programs), [Yusuke Endoh](https://github.com/mame)'s [`Qlobe`](https://mamememo.blogspot.com/2010/09/qlobe.html) (reproduced [here](https://github.com/knoxknox/qlobe)), their infamous [`quine-relay`](https://github.com/mame/quine-relay), and their [other projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6K7EmeptEHo)
  + The [G-Portugol](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-Portugol) programming language
  + [The unstable features mechanism](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html#unstable-features) in Rust ("first class support for experimental features") and how this allows for user experimentation
  + [Exclusive range patterns](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/37854) in Rust and some of their [perils](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/37854#issuecomment-575292595), specifically [in `tock`](https://github.com/tock/tock/issues/1544)
  + Contrasting the Rust unstable feature mechanism with [Haskell language pragmas](https://wiki.haskell.org/Language_Pragmas): the former requires a nightly compiler to use, the latter does not
- [@18:20](https://youtu.be/OqyqzFiP1P0?t=1101)
  *Discussion about the Rust process; going from RFC to stable Rust*
  + The Rust [inline assembly feature](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/inline-assembly.html) ([tracking issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2873))
  + The [Rust RFC repo](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs)
  + The [Generic Associated Types (GATs) Rust RFC](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/1598-generic_associated_types.html)
- [@24.30](https://youtu.be/OqyqzFiP1P0?t=1470)
  *hubris's use of nightly Rust*
  + [`hubris`](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/hubris) is [on `nightly` Rust](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/hubris/blob/875c53d3de2f26b3e0382343ed8556f92e40a0ba/rust-toolchain.toml#L2) but with an [allow list of features](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/hubris/commit/e3f699d534aa52567182718352af51af5b0de37f)
  + [Naked functions in Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1201-naked-fns.md) ([tracking issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/32408)), [Destructuring assignments](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2909-destructuring-assignment.html), [`#[cmse_nonsecure_entry]`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/75835)
  + Talking about [LWN](https://lwn.net/)-style reports and _curation_ as a way to lessen the pain of using Zulip style chat platforms for discussion
  + LWN is [hiring](https://lwn.net/Articles/895695/), looking for someone to keep up with Rust development, among other things
- [@29:30](https://youtu.be/OqyqzFiP1P0?t=1770)
  *Non-lexical lifetimes*
  + Importance of RFCs in understanding the origin of things in Rust - Value to working Rust programmers goes down over time
  + [Non-lexical lifetimes](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/08/05/nll-by-default.html) as a dividing point in the evolution of Rust
  + Scope is core to a Rust programmer's mental model - but programmers don't think about them in a lexical sense
  + NLL prevents writing spurious scopes to get past the compiler
- [@36:30](https://youtu.be/OqyqzFiP1P0?t=2190)
  *Good error messaging and focus on the programmer*
  + async/await providing good error messages
  + [Adam's blog entry](http://dtrace.org/blogs/ahl/2015/06/22/first-rust-program-pain/) on his initial experience with Rust
  + async Rust
  + imperfect compiler suggestions sometimes pointing you to a wrong path
  + The compiler asks you questions that need to be asked
  + near-vertical learning curve, gut punch to the ego
- [@48:20](https://youtu.be/OqyqzFiP1P0?t=2900)
  *Crossing the chasm*
  + [Business book](https://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Chasm-Marketing-High-Tech-Mainstream/dp/0060517123) - Lots of things die trying to get from the initial group of users to the laggards
  + When did Rust cross the chasm?  MVP of async / await dropping?  Used in many cases for network systems
  + Adam loves [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/)
  + removal of [green threads](https://github.com/nox/rust-rfcs/blob/master/text/0230-remove-runtime.md)
- [@1:06:15](https://youtu.be/OqyqzFiP1P0?t=3975)
  *Small features that have been added for QoL*
  + inline asm
  + [const generics](https://rustwiki.org/en/reference/items/generics.html#const-generics)
  + [Clippy](https://doc.rust-lang.org/clippy/) the Rust linter
  + [Rust Analyzer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer)
  + Programming in Rust making one a better C programmer
  + [Captured identifiers](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/01/13/Rust-1.58.0.html#captured-identifiers-in-format-strings)
  + no longer needing to use "extern crate" in Rust 2018
  + affinity between the way Rust views the world and [the way the Dutch build roads](https://www.kauaipath.org/content/how-dutch-made-their-streets-safer) (safety is part of the design)
- [@1:31:00](https://youtu.be/OqyqzFiP1P0?t=5460)
  *Putting words on dead trees*
  + crossing the chasm moment - release of [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and [Programming Rust](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust-2nd/9781492052586/) as physical books.
  + [Rust for Rustaceans](https://nostarch.com/rust-rustaceans)
  + Rust programmers go through stages: fighting the borrow checker, then crates are cool - use them everywhere, then a year later you can start to right idiomatic code
  + smal QoL feature: [cargo add](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-add.html)
  + Also: [links in rustdoc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/write-documentation/linking-to-items-by-name.html)

If we got something wrong or missed something, please file a PR!
Our next Twitter space will likely be on Monday at 5p Pacific Time; stay tuned
to our Twitter feeds for details.  We'd love to have you join us, as we
always love to hear from new speakers!
