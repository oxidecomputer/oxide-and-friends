# Oxide and Friends Twitter Space: July 18th, 2022

## Across the Chasm with Rust

We've been holding a Twitter Space weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour.
Even though it's not (yet?) a feature of Twitter Spaces, we have been
recording them all; here is
[the recording for our Twitter Space for July 18th, 2022](https://youtu.be/OqyqzFiP1P0).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://twitter.com/ahl),
our special guests were
[Steve Klabnik](https://twitter.com/steveklabnik) and
[Luqman Aden](https://twitter.com/luqma_).
Other speakers included
[Dan Cross](https://twitter.com/dancrossnyc),
[Tim McNamara](https://twitter.com/timClicks),
and [YY]().
(Did we miss your name and/or get it wrong? Drop a PR!)

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- [@0:27](https://youtu.be/OqyqzFiP1P0?t=27)
  *`let_chains` are stable in Rust 1.64*
  + [Adam's tweet](https://twitter.com/ahl/status/1548680684796911616)
  + [The stabilization PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/94927#event-7007028976), with the full saga leading up to stabilization
  + As Steve mentions, the feature dates [all the way back to 2017](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2260) and extends the [Swift-inspired `if let` expressions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/160) Rust has had for a while
  + Some Rust features, like [`async` functions in traits](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/3185-static-async-fn-in-trait.html), are [huge](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3185) rabbit [holes](http://www.smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2019/10/26/async-fn-in-traits-are-hard/)
  + Discussion about Rust's commitment to stability and how it's [enforced](https://brson.github.io/2017/07/10/how-rust-is-tested) with things like [`crater`](https://github.com/rust-lang/crater)
  + As an example of the _process_ leading to burnout in programming language communities: Guido [stepping down as BDFL](https://lwn.net/Articles/759654/) after [PEP 572](https://peps.python.org/pep-0572/) (Assignment Expressions, *"the walrus operator"*)
  + Discussion about Ruby also taking stability seriously: [`flip-flop`s](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/syntax/control_expressions_rdoc.html#label-Flip-Flop) [*weren't* removed in Ruby 2.0](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/5400) in part because of [this pretty incredible snippet](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/5400#note-3) from [Yusuke Endoh](https://github.com/mame)
  + [Quines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_%28computing%29) and [variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)#Ouroboros_programs), [Yusuke Endoh](https://github.com/mame)'s [`Qlobe`](https://mamememo.blogspot.com/2010/09/qlobe.html) (reproduced [here](https://github.com/knoxknox/qlobe)), their infamous [`quine-relay`](https://github.com/mame/quine-relay), and their [other projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6K7EmeptEHo)
  + The [G-Portugol](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-Portugol) programming language
  + [The unstable features mechanism](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html#unstable-features) in Rust ("first class support for experimental features") and how this allows for user experimentation
  + [Exclusive range patterns](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/37854) in Rust and some of their [perils](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/37854#issuecomment-575292595), specifically [in `tock`](https://github.com/tock/tock/issues/1544)
  + Contrasting the Rust unstable feature mechanism with [Haskell language pragmas](https://wiki.haskell.org/Language_Pragmas): the former requires a nightly compiler to use, the latter does not
- [@18:20](https://youtu.be/OqyqzFiP1P0?t=1101)
  *Discussion about the Rust process; going from RFC to stable Rust*
  + The Rust [inline assembly feature](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/inline-assembly.html) ([tracking issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2873))
  + The [Rust RFC repo](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs)
  + The [Generic Associated Types (GATs) Rust RFC](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/1598-generic_associated_types.html)
  + [`hubris`](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/hubris) is [on `nightly` Rust](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/hubris/blob/875c53d3de2f26b3e0382343ed8556f92e40a0ba/rust-toolchain.toml#L2) but with an [allow list of features](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/hubris/commit/e3f699d534aa52567182718352af51af5b0de37f)
  + [Naked functions in Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1201-naked-fns.md) ([tracking issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/32408)), [Destructuring assignments](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2909-destructuring-assignment.html), [`#[cmse_nonsecure_entry]`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/75835)
  + Talking about [LWN](https://lwn.net/)-style reports and _curation_ as a way to lessen the pain of using Zulip style chat platforms for discussion
  + LWN is [hiring](https://lwn.net/Articles/895695/), looking for someone to keep up with Rust development, among other things
