## Predictions 2025

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording]().

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://bsky.app/profile/bcantrill.bsky.social) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://bsky.app/profile/ahl.bsky.social),
speakers included
[XXX](),
and [YY]().

We crack the Tbps barrier in the enterprise for a single ethernet link (currently 800Gbps)

Hardware for CXL will enter GA, software won't be there to take advantage quite yet

RISC-V enters the datacenter via Tenstorrent in the form of "AI acceleration cards". Nobody figures out how the hell to use them for about 2-3 years though.
</td>
<td>
25Gbps over CAT7/CAT8 happens, meaning that we'll see more consumer hardware supporting it as a step up from 10GbE.
  
CXL is used in the building of a HPC cluster, supplementing InfiniBand / Ethernet. Software support starts picking up, people start figuring out how to use it

Someone outside of AMD/NVIDIA/AWS/Azure finally figures out how to properly make use of DPUs, and we see proper software support & adoption. Could be in the form of CNIs (for Kubernetes), whatnot.

We see a rise in more exotic cooling solutions in the datacenter (mineral oil immersion, water-based, maybe even liquid nitrogen?) due to ever-increasing power requirements from GPUs + x86 servers

OCP racks will enter GA, meaning blind-mated 48VDC power backplanes for all, albeit in a vastly different form factor from regular 42U racks.

K8s will continue to remain supreme and eat up more market share from VMware's remains

It becomes seamless to transition off of x86 -> ARM, thanks to a new compatibility layer that {Amazon, Ampere, NVIDIA, etc} developed, very similar to Rosetta 2 (Apple).
</td>
<td>
GPUs are entirely racked separately from compute blades in datacenters, connected over CXL fabric (rack-to-rack).
  
ARM market-share in the datacenter increases dramatically, thanks to better thermals + performance compared to x86, as well as the afformentioned compatibiltiy layer.

Our next show will likely be on Monday at 5p Pacific Time on our Discord
server; stay tuned to our Mastodon feeds for details, or [subscribe to this

We'd love to have you join us, as we always love to hear from new speakers!
