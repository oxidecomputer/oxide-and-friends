# Oxide and Friends Twitter Space: June 20th, 2022

## Paths into Systems Programming

We've been holding a Twitter Space weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour.
Even though it's not (yet?) a feature of Twitter Spaces, we have been
recording them all; here is
[the recording for our Twitter Space for June 20th, 2022](https://youtu.be/IG1JVKeeaGs).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://twitter.com/ahl),
speakers on June 20th included
[XXX](),
and [YY]().
(Did we miss your name and/or get it wrong? Drop a PR!)

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- [Privilege Mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_(computing)
- [ELF Binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format)
- [Systems We Love](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3Pk-8hhzME2w5BL_JvXfRg)
- [@M:SS](link into recording)
  *Leventhal's Conundrum*
- PRs needed!

If we got something wrong or missed something, please file a PR!
Our next Twitter space will likely be on Monday at 5p Pacific Time; stay tuned
to our Twitter feeds for details.  We'd love to have you join us, as we
always love to hear from new speakers!
