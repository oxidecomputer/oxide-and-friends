# Oxide and Friends: January 20th, 2025

## Holistic Engineering with Robert Mustacchi

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording](b).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://bsky.app/profile/bcantrill.bsky.social) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://bsky.app/profile/ahl.bsky.social),
we were joined by Oxide colleague,
Robert Mustacchi.

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:
