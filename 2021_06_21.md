# Twitter Space on June 21, 2021

We've been holding a Twitter Space weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour.
Even though it's not (yet?) a feature of Twitter Spaces, we have been
recording them all; here is
[the recording for our Twitter Space for June 21, 2021](https://youtu.be/UOucW3F7nCg).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://twitter.com/ahl),
speakers on June 21st included
[Dan Cross](https://twitter.com/dancrossnyc),
[Sean Klein](https://twitter.com/does_he_byte),
[Aram Hăvărneanu](https://twitter.com/aramh),
and the mononymous [Nate](https://twitter.com/perlhack).
(Did we miss your name and/or get it wrong? Drop a PR!)

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- [Adam's toddler](https://twitter.com/ahl/status/1381978199404371968) (being chased by a rooster)
  > Don't get me wrong, some of my best friends are three-year-olds.

  - [MDB](https://illumos.org/books/mdb/intro-1.html#intro-1) Modular Debugger
  > Adam: I think people are using cargo-cult debugging, rather than getting to the root cause
  > of these things, or being satisfied until they get to the root cause. \
  > Bryan: I think with software systems, it's really hard to know what they're actually doing.
  - [Procedure Linkage Table][plt] aka "the plits"
  - "Runtime Performance Analysis of the M-to-N Scheduling Model" ([pdf][m2n]) 1996 undergrad thesis

  - [TNF](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19504-01/802-5880/6i9k05dgd/index.html) Trace Normal Form
  > Part of the problem with debuggers... debuggers are historically written by compiler folks,
  > and not system folks. As a result, debuggers are designed to debug the problem that
  > compiler folks have the most familiarity with, and that's a compiler. \
  > Debuggers are designed for reproducible problems, way too frequently.
  
  > I view in situ breakpoint debugging as one sliver of debugging that's useful for
  > one particular and somewhat unusual class of bugs. That's actually not the kind of
  > debugger I want to use most of the time.

  > it's doing it badly.

  Cardinal rule of debuggers: Don't kill the patient!
  (see also: [Do No Harm](https://youtu.be/c8yURlfmRnw?t=1039))
  > Not killing the patient is really important,
  > this was always an [Ur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ur) principle for us.
 
  > The notion that the debugger has now become load bearing in the execution of the program,
  > is a pretty grave responsibility.
- [[Listen 26:54]](https://youtu.be/UOucW3F7nCg?t=1614) Post-mortem debugging
  > It is a tragedy of our domain that we do not debug post-mortem, routinely.

  > What's going on in the system? It's not crashing, there's no core dump.
  > But the system is behaving in a way I didn't expect it to, and I want to know why.
- [[Listen 33:51]](https://youtu.be/UOucW3F7nCg?t=2031)
  Pre-production reliability techniques
  > All of our pre-production work has gotten way better than it was, and I think that's
  > compensation for the fact we can't understand these systems when we deploy them.
- [[Listen 37:58]](https://youtu.be/UOucW3F7nCg?t=2278)

  - [HOPL](https://hopl4.sigplan.org/) History of Programming Languages
  > There was a test suite of excellence when it comes to automated program debugging.
  > And it was some pile of C programs with known bugs, and you would throw your new
  > paper at it, and it would find 84% of the bugs, and there would be a lot of
  > slapping each other on the back on that. Really focused on the simplest of simple bugs.
  - [[Listen 43:15]](https://youtu.be/UOucW3F7nCg?t=2595)

  > This is a game of bingo across the entire address space.
  
  > We can follow the pointers and propagate types.

  `printf/println` debugging -- everyone's doing it
  > I think it's a mistake for people to denigrate `printf` debugging.
  > If you've got a situation that you can debug quickly with `printf`, you should do that.
  - [Early, sometimes student-friendly IDEs](http://cs.brown.edu/people/spr/researchenv.html)
  > These poor students are weeping in the Sun lab at two in the morning because they
  > can't debug their programs, because they're not allowed to use `printf`

Our next Twitter space will likely be on Monday at 5p Pacific Time; stay tuned
to our Twitter feeds for details.  We'd love to have you join us, as we
always love to hear from new speakers!
